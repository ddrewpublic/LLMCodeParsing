Here is the modified code with developer comments and a summary:

**Part I**

```c
int sum;
int yin(int c,int g)// Function yin calculates the sum of proper divisors of a number
{
    int j,k,f,e;
    for(j=g;j<=c;j++)// Loop through all numbers from g to c (inclusive)
    {
        if(c%j==0)// Check if j is a divisor of c
        {
           e=c/j;
            if(e>1)// Check if e is greater than 1 (avoid counting 1 and the number itself as divisors)
            {
                f=j;
                yin(e,f);// Recursively call yin to find divisors of e
            }
            else sum++;// If e is 1, increment the sum (this will be used to count the number of proper divisors)
        }
    }
    return sum;// Return the sum of proper divisors
}

int main()
{
    int n,a[1000],b[1000],i,d;
    cin>>n;// Read the number of elements to process
    for(i=0;i<n;i++) cin>>a[i];// Read the elements
```

**Part II**

The code provided is a C++ program that calculates the number of proper divisors for a given set of integers. The function `yin` takes two integer parameters, `c` and `g`, where `c` is the number to be processed and `g` is the starting number for the search of divisors. The function returns the sum of proper divisors of `c`.

The `main` function takes `n` integer inputs and uses a loop to calculate the sum of proper divisors for each input number. The result is stored in an array `b`. Finally, the program prints the contents of `b` to the console.

The program uses a recursive approach to find the proper divisors of a number. For each divisor `j` of `c`, it checks if `j` is less than or equal to `c`. If `j` is a divisor, it calculates the quotient `e` and checks if `e` is greater than 1. If `e` is greater than 1, it means that `j` is a proper divisor of `c`, so it calls `yin` recursively with `e` and `j` as arguments. If `e` is 1, it increments the sum.

The time complexity of the program is O(n), where n is the maximum value of the input numbers. The space complexity is O(1), as the sum and recursive function calls do not occupy extra space proportional to the input size.
