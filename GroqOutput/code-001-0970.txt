**Part II: Summary**

This program, Divide.cpp, is designed to count the number of divisors of a given number. The program takes an integer input and recursively calculates the number of divisors for that number. The main function reads the number of inputs and processes them one by one, resetting the sum for each input and calling the function to find the divisors. The program prints the sum of divisors for each input and then terminates. The function f uses a loop to check the divisors of a number within a given range, and recursively calls itself until it reaches the smallest divisor. The sum is incremented for each divisor found and finally printed at the end.
