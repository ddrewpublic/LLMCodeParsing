**Part I: Code with Comments**

```c
void main()
{
    // Declare variable to store the number of strings
    int n, i, j, k;

    // Declare array to store the frequency of each character
    int at[26] = {0};

    // Declare variable to store the current character
    char c;

    // Read the number of strings
    scanf("%d", &n);

    // Declare a structure to store the id and character array
    struct st
    {
        int id;
        char s[27];
    }a[999], *p;

    // Read the id and string for each structure
    for (p = a; p < a + n; p++)
        scanf("%d %s", &p->id, p->s);

    // Loop through each string
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        // Loop through each character in the string
        for (j = 0;; j++)
        {
            // Read the current character
            c = a[i].s[j];

            // If the character is not null, increment its frequency
            if (c != '\0') at[c - 65]++;
            // If the character is null, break the loop
            else break;
        }
    }

    // Find the maximum frequency
    int max = 0;
    for (i = 0; i < 26; i++)
    {
        // If the frequency is greater than the maximum, update the maximum
        if (at[i] > max)
        {
            max = at[i];
            j = i;
        }
    }

    // Convert the index to a character and print it
    char x;
    x = j + 65;
    printf("%c\n%d\n", x, max);

    // Loop through each string again
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        // Loop through each character in the string
        for (j = 0;; j++)
        {
            // Read the current character
            c = a[i].s[j];

            // If the character is the maximum frequent character, print the id
            if (c == x) printf("%d\n", a[i].id);
            // If the character is null, break the loop
            if (c == '\0') break;
        }
    }
}
```

**Part II: Summary**

This program aims to find the most frequently occurring character in a set of strings and print out the characters and their corresponding ids. It takes as input a set of strings with their corresponding ids, and outputs the most frequent character and the ids of the strings that contain that character.
