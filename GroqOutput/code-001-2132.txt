Here is the code with developer comments:


**Part I**

```cpp
int fenjie(int n, int min)
{
    // Initialize variables i, a, and x to 0
    int i, a = 0, x = 0;
    
    // Iterate from i = 2 to n (inclusive)
    for(i = 2; i <= n; i++)
    {
        // If n is divisible by i, increment a by 1
        if(n % i == 0)
            a = a + 1;
    }
    
    // If n is 1, return 1
    if(n == 1)
        return 1;
    else
    {
        // Initialize x to 0
        for(i = min; i <= n; i++)
        {
            // If n is divisible by i, increment x by the result of fenjie(n/i, i)
            if(n % i == 0)
                x = x + fenjie(n/i, i);
        }
        // Return x
        return x;
    }
}
```

**Part II**

This code is an implementation of a function to calculate the prime factorization of a given integer `n`. The function `fenjie(n, min)` takes two parameters: `n` (the number to be factorized) and `min` (the minimum possible divisor).

The function works by iterating from `i = 2` to `n` and checking if `n` is divisible by `i`. If it is, the function increments a counter `a` to keep track of the number of divisors. If `n` is 1, the function returns 1, since 1 has only one divisor (itself).

If `n` is not 1, the function calls itself recursively with `n/i` as the new `n` and `i` as the new `min`. This process continues until `n` is reduced to 1. The final result `x` is the sum of all the prime factorizations.

In the `main` function, the program reads an integer `t` from the input and then iterates `t` times to read an integer `num` and prints the result of calling `fenjie(num, 2)` for each `num`.
