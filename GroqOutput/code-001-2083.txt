Here is the code with developer comments:

**Part I**
```c
int fenjie(int n, int min)
{
  // Initialize x to 0, i will be a loop variable
  int x = 0, i;
  
  // If n is 1, return 1 immediately
  if (n == 1)
    return 1;
    
  // Otherwise, recursively call fenjie for each divisor of n starting from min
  else
  {
    for (i = min; i <= n; i++)
    {
      // Check if i is a divisor of n
      if (n % i == 0)
        x = x + fenjie(n / i, i); // Recursively call fenjie with n/i and i
    }
  }
  // Return the final value of x
  return x;
}
```

**Part II**

Summary:

The provided code is a recursive function that calculates the sum of proper divisors of a given number `n`. The function `fenjie` takes two arguments: `n` (the number to find divisors for) and `min` (the starting point for the search). It returns the sum of all proper divisors of `n` greater than or equal to `min`.

The function works by recursively dividing `n` by each divisor `i` starting from `min`, and adding the result to `x`. The recursion continues until `n` is reduced to 1. The final value of `x` is the sum of all proper divisors of `n`.

The main function reads a series of numbers from input, calls `fenjie` for each number starting from 2, and prints the result. It then reads one more number and prints the sum of its proper divisors starting from 2.
