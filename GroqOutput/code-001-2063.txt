Part I

main()
{
    int n;  // declare a variable n to store the input number
    scanf("%d",&n);  // read an integer from the standard input and store it in n
    for (int i = 1;i <= n;i ++)  // loop through n times

        for (int j = 2; j < q; j ++)  // loop through the numbers from 2 to q
        {
            if (x%j==0)  // check if x is divisible by j
                answer+=shuliang(j,x/j);  // call the shuliang function with j and x/j as input and add the return value to answer
        }
        printf("%d\n\n",answer);  // print the value of answer to the standard output
    }

    }
    if(y==1)  // check if y is 1

Part II

This program is designed to calculate the sum of the proper divisors of a given number x. The main function takes an integer n as input, reads n integers x from the standard input, and then prints the sum of the proper divisors of each x.

The shuliang function is a recursive function that calculates the sum of the proper divisors of a given number n. It takes two integers m and n as input, and returns the sum of the proper divisors of n.

In the main function, the shuliang function is called recursively to calculate the sum of the proper divisors of each x. The function uses a loop to iterate through the numbers from 2 to the square root of x, and checks if x is divisible by each number. If x is divisible, the function calls itself recursively with the divisor and the quotient of x, and adds the return value to the answer.

The program uses the concept of proper divisors, which are the divisors of a number except for 1 and the number itself. The shuliang function calculates the sum of the proper divisors of a given number, and the main function prints the sum for each input number.

Overall, this program is designed to demonstrate the concept of proper divisors and how to calculate the sum of the proper divisors of a given number.
