**Part II: Summary**

This program calculates the number of prime numbers in a sequence of numbers. It uses a recursive function `f` to count the number of prime numbers. The function takes two parameters `n` and `N`, where `n` is the current number being processed and `N` is the highest divisor of `n`. The function recursively divides `n` by `N` until `N` is 1, and increments the `answer` variable each time it finds a divisor. The `main` function reads input for `n` and `a`, calls the `f` function with `a` and `a`, and prints the answer. The `answer` variable is reset to 0 at the beginning of each iteration to ensure accurate counting of prime numbers.
