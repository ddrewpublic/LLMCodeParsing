**Part I: Code with Comments**

```c
int sum=0,t;          // Initialize sum variable to 0 and t to some value

void dg(int s)        // Define a function dg that takes an integer s as an argument
{
	for(int i=s;i<=t;i++)  // Loop from s to t
	{
		if(t%i==0)   // If t is divisible by i
		{
			t=t/i;  // Divide t by i
			if(t==1) sum++;   // If t becomes 1, increment sum by 1
			else dg(i);       // Recursively call dg with current i
			t=t*i;  // Multiply t by i to restore original value
		}
	}
}

int main()
{
	int n;
	cin>>n;            // Read an integer n from input
	while(n--)       // Loop till n becomes 0
	{
		cin>>t;         // Read another integer t from input
		dg(2);          // Call dg function with 2 as the initial value
		cout<<sum<<endl;  // Print the current sum value
		sum=0;         // Reset sum to 0 for the next iteration
	}
	return 0;
}
```

**Part II: Summary**

The given code implements a function `dg` that calculates the number of prime factors of a given number `t`. The function uses a recursive approach to find the prime factors of `t`, starting from 2 and incrementing by 1 until it reaches `t`.

The `main` function reads an integer `n` from input and then loops `n` times. In each iteration, it reads another integer `t` from input and calls the `dg` function with 2 as the initial value. The `dg` function returns the count of prime factors of `t`, which is then printed to the output. The `sum` variable is reset to 0 at the beginning of each iteration to keep track of the count of prime factors for the next iteration.
