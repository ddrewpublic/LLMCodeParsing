**Part II: Summary**

This C++ program calculates the sum of divisors of a given number for multiple test cases. The `f` function takes an integer `a` and an integer `s` (start) as input and returns the sum of divisors of `a`. It iterates over all numbers from `s` to the square root of `a` and updates the sum of divisors accordingly. The `main` function reads the number of test cases, processes each test case by reading a number and calculating its sum of divisors using the `f` function, and then prints the result. The program terminates after processing all test cases.
