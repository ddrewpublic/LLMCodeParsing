**Part I**

```c
int num=1,k=0;
```
This line declares two integer variables `num` and `k` and initializes them to 1 and 0 respectively.

```c
int count(int n)
{
```
This line declares a function `count` that takes an integer `n` as a parameter.

```c
for(int i=2;i<=sqrt(n);i++)
```
This line starts a for loop that iterates from 2 to the square root of `n`. This loop is used to check if `n` is prime.

```c
if(n%i==0&&i>=k)
```
This line checks if `n` is divisible by `i` and if `i` is greater than or equal to `k`. This is used to handle prime factors.

```c
{
	num++;
	k=i;
	count(n/i);
	k=0;
}
```
If the conditions in the if statement are met, this block of code increments `num`, updates `k` to `i`, recursively calls `count` with `n/i` as the new value of `n`, and resets `k` to 0.

```c
return (num);
}
```
This line returns the value of `num` from the function.

```c
int main()
```
This line declares the main function.

```c
int i,n,a[100];
cin>>n;
```
This line declares an integer array `a` of size 100, reads an integer `n` from the input, and stores it in the variable `n`.

```c
for(i=0;i<n;i++)
{
	cin>>a[i];
}
```
This loop reads `n` integers from the input and stores them in the array `a`.

```c
for(i=0;i<n;i++)
{cout<<count(a[i])<<endl;num=1;k=0;}
```
This loop calls the function `count` for each integer in the array `a` and prints the result to the output.

```c
return 0;
}
```
This line ends the main function and returns 0.

**Part II**

This code is used to count the number of divisors of a given integer. The `count` function recursively checks for divisors of the input number starting from 2 and updating the maximum divisor found so far. The `main` function reads a set of integers from the input, calculates the number of divisors for each integer, and prints the results. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n sqrt(n)) where n is the input number, making it less efficient for large input numbers.
