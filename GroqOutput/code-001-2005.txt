Here is the 200-word summary for the code, using the header "Part II":

Part II

This C++ program is designed to calculate the number of ways to factor a given integer. The program uses a recursive function, `factor`, which takes two parameters, `a` and `f`. The function returns the number of ways to factor `a` using `f` as the factor. The function divides the problem into two sub-problems: if the current factor is equal to the given integer, it returns 1; if the given integer is less than the current factor, it returns 0; otherwise, it recursively calls itself with the integer divided by the current factor and the next factor.

The `main` function reads the number of integers to factor from the input and uses a while loop to factor each integer until there are no more integers to factor. The program outputs the result of each factorization. The program is efficient because it uses a recursive approach to factor the integer, which reduces the number of operations required to factor large integers.
