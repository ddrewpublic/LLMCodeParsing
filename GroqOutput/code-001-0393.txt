**Part I: Code**

```c
int s=0,z=2;// Initialize two variables, s and z, to 0 and 2 respectively

void number(int x,int y)
{    // Define a function called number that takes two integers, x and y, as parameters
    int i;
	if(x==1) 
	{
		s=s+1;
	}// If x is equal to 1, increment the value of s by 1
	for(i=y;i<=x;i++)
	{
		if(x%i==0) 
		{ 
			number(x/i , i);
		}// If x is divisible by i, recursively call the function with the quotient of x and i, and i as new values for x and y
	}
}
```

**Part II: Summary**

This code is a C++ program that calculates the sum of all divisors for a given set of numbers. The program first initializes two variables, s and z, to 0 and 2 respectively. It then defines a function called number that takes two integers, x and y, as parameters. This function checks if x is equal to 1 and increments the value of s by 1 if true. It then recursively calls itself with the quotient of x and i, and i as new values for x and y, for all numbers from y to x, checking if x is divisible by i at each step. The main function reads a number n from the input, and for each number a from 1 to n, it calls the number function with a and z as parameters, and then prints the value of s. Finally, it resets the value of s to 0 for the next iteration.
