Here is the code with developer comments for each line, and a summary at the end:

**Part I**
```
struct chs{
    char zz[27];
    int num;
}cs[],*p;
```

* Define a struct `chs` with two members: `zz` (a character array of length 27) and `num` (an integer).

```
int main(){
    int n;
    scanf("%d",&n);
```

* Declare a variable `n` to store the number of elements in the array.
* Read an integer from the standard input using `scanf` and store it in `n`.

```
    struct chs *cs=(struct chs *)malloc(sizeof(struct chs)*n);
```

* Allocate memory for an array of `chs` structs using `malloc`. The size of each struct is `sizeof(struct chs)`, and the total size is `n` times that.

```
    for(p=cs;p<cs+n;p++){
        scanf("%d%s",&(p->num),p->zz);
    }
```

* Iterate through the array of `chs` structs using a pointer `p`. For each element, read an integer and a string using `scanf` and store them in the corresponding members of the struct.

```
    int l,a,zm[26],*z;
```

* Declare an array `zm` of size 26 to store the frequency of each letter.
* Initialize a pointer `z` to point to the beginning of `zm`.

```
    for(z=zm;z<zm+26;z++){
        *z=0;
    }
```

* Set each element of `zm` to 0 using a loop.

```
    char *q;
    for(p=cs;p<cs+n;p++){
        l=strlen(p->zz);
        for(q=p->zz;*q!='\0';q++){
            a=(int)(*q);
            (*(zm+a-65))++;
        }
    }
```

* Iterate through each string in the array of `chs` structs using a pointer `q`. For each character, convert it to an integer and increment the corresponding frequency in `zm`.

```
    int max=0;
    for(z=zm;z<zm+26;z++){
        if(*z>*(zm+max)){
            max=z-zm;
        }
    }
```

* Find the maximum frequency in `zm` using a loop.

```
    printf("%c\n%d\n",(char)(max+65),*(zm+max));
```

* Print the character corresponding to the maximum frequency (using the ASCII value 65 to convert the index to a character) and the frequency itself.

```
    for(p=cs;p<cs+n;p++){
        l=strlen(p->zz);
        for(q=p->zz;*q!='\0';q++){
            a=(int)(*q);
            if((a-65)==max){
                printf("%d\n",p->num);
            }
        }
    }
```

* Iterate through each string in the array of `chs` structs again, and for each character, check if its frequency is equal to the maximum frequency. If it is, print the corresponding `num` value.

```
    free(cs);
    return 0;
}
```

* Free the memory allocated for the array of `chs` structs using `free`.
* Return 0 to indicate successful execution.

**Part II**

This program reads a number `n` from the standard input, followed by `n` pairs of integers and strings. It then analyzes the strings to find the most frequently occurring letter, and prints the corresponding letter and the frequency. Finally, it prints all the numbers associated with the strings that contain the most frequent letter. The program assumes that the input strings only contain uppercase letters.

Note that the program uses a fixed-sized array `zm` to store the frequency of each letter, which may not be suitable for large inputs. A more efficient approach would be to use a hash table or a dynamic array to store the frequencies. Additionally, the program does not handle errors or invalid input, which may cause the program to produce incorrect results or crash.
