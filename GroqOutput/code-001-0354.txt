Here is the code with developer comments:

**Part I**

```c
int number = 0;  // Initialize a variable to count the number of prime factors
int l;  // Initialize a variable to store the largest divisor of a number
void sort (int n)  // Define a function to count the number of prime factors
{
    int i;  // Initialize a variable for looping
    for (i=l; n/i >= i; i++)  // Loop through all possible divisors of n
    {
        if (n%i == 0)  // Check if i is a divisor of n
        {
            l = i;  // Update the largest divisor of n
            sort (n/i);  // Recursively call the function on the remaining factor
            if (n/i == 1)  // If the remaining factor is 1, it means n is a prime number
                number++;  // Increment the count
        }
    }
    number++;  // Increment the count after the recursive call
}
```

**Part II**

Summary:

The given code calculates the number of prime factors of a given number n. The code first defines a recursive function sort() to count the number of prime factors of a number. In the sort() function, it iterates through all possible divisors of the number, identifying prime factors by checking if the divisor is equal to the number itself. If the divisor is a prime factor, it updates the largest divisor and recursively calls the function on the remaining factor. The function also increments a count variable number to keep track of the number of prime factors. The main function reads multiple numbers from the input and calculates the number of prime factors for each, finally outputting the results.
