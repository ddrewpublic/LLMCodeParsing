**Part I**

Here is the code with developer comments:
```
int su(int input)//Function to check if a number is prime
{
    int ju=1; // Initialize a flag to 1, assuming the number is prime
    for(int i=2;i<sqrt(input);i++)// Loop through all numbers up to the square root of the input
    {
        if(input%i==0)// If the input is divisible by i, it's not prime
        {
            ju=0; // Set the flag to 0
            break; // Exit the loop immediately
        }
    }
    return ju; // Return the flag
}

int fenjie(int input, int k)//Function to factorize a number
{
    int ret=1; // Initialize a result variable to 1
    for(int i=k;i<=sqrt(input);i++)// Loop through all numbers from k upwards to the square root of the input
    {
        if(input%i==0)// If the input is divisible by i
        {
            if(su(input/i)==0)// And the quotient is not prime
            {
                ret=fenjie(input/i,i)+ret; // Recursively factorize the quotient
            }
        }
    }
    return ret; // Return the result
}

int main()
{
    int input,num,sol; // Declare variables for input, number of inputs, and solution
    cin>>num; // Read the number of inputs from the console
    while(num--)// Loop through each input
    {
        cin>>input; // Read the input from the console
        cout<<fenjie(input,2)<<endl; // Call the factorize function and print the result
    }
    return 0; // Return from main
}
```
**Part II**

This code is designed to factorize a given number into its prime factors. The `su` function checks if a number is prime by iterating through all numbers up to its square root and checking for divisibility. The `fenjie` function recursively factorizes a number by iterating through all numbers from a given start value to the square root of the input, and checking for divisibility. If the quotient is not prime, it is recursively factorized. The `main` function reads a number of inputs from the console, and for each input, it calls the `fenjie` function with a start value of 2 and prints the result.

The code is designed to be efficient by only iterating up to the square root of the input, and by using a recursive function to factorize the quotient. However, it may still be slow for very large inputs due to the exponential time complexity of the recursive function.
