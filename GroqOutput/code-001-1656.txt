**Part I**

```c
int meide(int x,int y)
{
    // Function to calculate the sum of divisors of a number
    int sum=1; // Initialize the sum with 1 (1 is a divisor of every number)
    int count=0; // Initialize the count with 0 (not used in the function)
    int i; // Initialize the variable i
    for(i=y;i<=sqrt(x);i++)
    {
        // Loop through all numbers from y to the square root of x
        if(x%i==0)
        {
            // Check if i is a divisor of x
            sum=sum+meide(x/i,i); // If i is a divisor, recursively call the function with x/i and i
        }
    }
    return sum; // Return the sum of divisors
}
```

```c
int main()
{
    // Main function
    int k,n,m; // Declare variables k, n, and m
    scanf("%d",&k); // Read the value of k
    for(m=0;m<k;m++)
    {
        // Loop through k times
        scanf("%d",&n); // Read the value of n
        if(n>=3)
        {
            // If n is greater than or equal to 3
            printf("%d\n",meide(n,2)); // Calculate and print the sum of divisors of n using the meide function
        }
        else
        {
            // If n is less than 3
            printf("1\n"); // Print 1 (since 1 is the sum of divisors of 1 and 2)
        }
    }
    return 0; // Return 0 to indicate success
}
```

**Part II**

This code is designed to calculate the sum of divisors of a given number. The main function reads the value of k and then loops through k times. In each iteration, it reads the value of n and checks if it is greater than or equal to 3. If it is, it calls the meide function to calculate the sum of divisors of n using the meide function. If n is less than 3, it prints 1 as the sum of divisors. The meide function uses a recursive approach to calculate the sum of divisors by iterating through all numbers from y to the square root of x.
