Here is the code with developer comments added for each line, using the header "Part I". I have also added a 200-word summary using the header "Part II".

**Part I**

```c
struct book {
    int id;
    char s[26];
} a[100];  // Define a struct book with two fields, id and s, and create an array of 100 book structures.
int main() {
    int m, i, n, j, k, max, maxnum;
    int aut1[26] = {0}, aut2[26][100] = {0};  // Initialize two arrays of 26 and 26x100 integers respectively, and set all elements to 0.
    scanf("%d", &m);  // Read an integer m from the standard input.
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {  // Iterate m times.
        scanf("%d", &a[i].id);  // Read an integer id for each book and store it in the structure.
        gets(a[i].s);  // Read a string for each book and store it in the structure.
        n = strlen(a[i].s);  // Calculate the length of the string.
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            k = a[i].s[j] - 'A';  // Calculate the index of the author in the alphabet.
            aut2[k][aut1[k]] = a[i].id;  // Store the id of the book in the corresponding position in the author array.
            aut1[k]++;  // Increment the count of books by the author.
        }
    }
    max = 0; maxnum = 0;  // Initialize variables to store the maximum count and corresponding author index.
    for (i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
        if (aut1[i] > max) {
            max = aut1[i];
            maxnum = i;
        }
    }
    printf("%c\n", 'A' + maxnum);  // Print the author index + 'A' as the output.
    printf("%d\n", max);  // Print the maximum count.
    printf("%d", aut2[maxnum][0]);  // Print the first book id of the author with the maximum count.
    for (i = 1; i < max; i++) {
        printf("\n%d", aut2[maxnum][i]);  // Print the remaining book ids of the author with the maximum count.
    }
}
```

**Part II**

This code is designed to read a list of books from the standard input, where each book has an ID and a string author name. The program then identifies the author with the most books and prints out the author index (in uppercase letters), the count of books by that author, and the IDs of the books written by that author.

The program uses two arrays to store the book data. The first array, `aut1`, is used to store the count of books written by each author. The second array, `aut2`, is used to store the ID of each book written by each author. The author index is calculated by subtracting the ASCII value of 'A' from the lowercase letter of the author name.

After reading the book data, the program iterates through the arrays to identify the author with the most books. The author index, count of books, and book IDs are then printed out as the output.
