Part II

Summary:

This is a C++ program that calculates the sum of divisors for a given set of numbers. The program defines a function `f` that takes two integers `a` and `min` as parameters. It calculates the sum of divisors of `a` by recursively calling itself with `a/j` as the new parameter, where `j` is a divisor of `a`. The program then uses a loop to read in a set of numbers and calls the `f` function for each number, printing the sum of divisors to the console.
