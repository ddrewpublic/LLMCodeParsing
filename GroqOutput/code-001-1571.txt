```
int main()
{
    // Declare a variable n of type int
    int n,i,a,factor(int N,int min);
    // Read an integer from the user using scanf and store it in n
    scanf("%d",&n);
    // Loop n times
    for(i=0;i<n;i++)
    {
        // Read an integer from the user using scanf and store it in a
        scanf("%d",&a);
        // Call the factor function with arguments a and 2, and print the result
        printf("%d\n",factor(a,2));
    }
    // Return 0 to indicate successful execution
    return 0;
}

int factor(int N,int min)
{
    // Declare variables i and result of type int
    int i,result;
    // Initialize result to 1
    result=1;
    
    // If N is less than min, return 0
    if(N<min)
    {
        return 0;
    }
    // Loop from min to N
    for(i=min;i<N;i++)
    {
        // If N is divisible by i, recursively call factor with N/i and i
        if(N%i==0)
        {
            result+=factor(N/i,i);
        }

    return result;
}
```

**Part II**

This code is a implementation of the function to find the sum of all factors of a given number. The function `factor` takes two arguments, `N` and `min`, where `N` is the number for which the sum of factors is to be found, and `min` is the minimum factor to be considered. This function calls itself recursively to find the sum of all factors.

In the main function, it reads a number `n` from the user, then reads `n` numbers from the user and for each number, it calls the `factor` function with the number and 2, and then prints the result. The result is the sum of all factors of the given number.

The code is well commented to understand the logic behind it and helps to debug the code easily.
