**Part I**

```c
int qq(int m){  // Function to check if a number is prime
    int i,j;  // Declare integer variables
    j=0;  // Initialize j to 0
    for(i=2;i*i<=j;i++){
     if(m%i==0){  // If the number is divisible by i
      j=1;  // Set j to 1 to indicate it's not prime
     }
     break;  // Exit the loop early since it's not prime
     }
     return j;  // Return 0 if the number is prime, 1 if not
     }
     
int pp(int m,int j){  // Function to calculate the prime factors of a number
   int i,k=0;  // Declare integer variables and initialize k to 0
   if(m==1)  // If the number is 1, return 1
   return 1;
   else {
   k++;  // Increment k to keep track of the number of factors
   for(i=j;i*i<=m;i++){
    if(qq(i)==0&&m%i==0){  // If i is prime and divides m
     k=k+pp(m/i,i);  // Recursively call pp with m/i and i
     }
     }
   }  
  return k;

**Part II**

Summary:

The code provided is a program that calculates the prime factors of a given set of numbers. It consists of two functions: `qq` and `pp`. The `qq` function checks if a number is prime, and the `pp` function calculates the prime factors of a number. The `main` function reads a set of numbers from the user, calculates their prime factors using the `pp` function, and prints the results.

The `qq` function uses a simple trial division method to check if a number is prime. It iterates from 2 to the square root of the number, and if it finds a divisor, it sets `j` to 1 to indicate that the number is not prime. If no divisors are found, it returns 0, indicating that the number is prime.

The `pp` function uses a recursive approach to calculate the prime factors of a number. It starts by checking if the number is 1, in which case it returns 1. Otherwise, it iterates from the given value of `j` (usually 2) to the square root of the number, and if it finds a prime factor `i`, it recursively calls `pp` with the quotient `m/i` and `i`. The function returns the total number of prime factors found.
