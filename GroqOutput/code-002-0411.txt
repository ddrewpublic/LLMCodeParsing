Here is the code with developer comments:

**Part I**

```c
struct book {
    int no;
    char author[26];
};  // structure to hold information about a book
ji[1000];  // array of 1000 structures of type book
main() {
    int n, i, j, len, a[26][1000], e, b[26] = {0}, max = 0;  // declare variables
    scanf("%d", &n);  // read the number of books
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        scanf("%d%s", &ji[i].no, ji[i].author);  // read a book's information
        len = strlen(ji[i].author);  // calculate the length of the author's name
        for (j = 0; j < len; j++) {
            e = ji[i].author[j];
            e = e - 65;  // convert the character to a number (A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25)
            a[e][b[e]] = ji[i].no;  // store the book number in the array
            b[e] = b[e] + 1;  // increment the count of books by this author
        }
    }
```

**Part II**

Summary:

This program reads information about books and their authors. Each book is represented by a structure that contains the book number and the author's name. The program uses an array to store the book numbers for each author, and another array to keep track of the count of books by each author. The final output is the author with the most books, followed by the numbers of those books.

For each book, the program reads the author's name and converts each character to a number (A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25) using the formula `e = ji[i].author[j] - 65`. It then stores the book number in the corresponding array and increments the count. After reading all books, the program finds the author with the most books by iterating through the counts array and updating the maximum if necessary. Finally, it prints the author's name (converted back to a character using the formula `max + 65`) and the numbers of their books.
