Here is the code with developer comments added:
```c
main() {
    // Declare integer variables n, i, j, and max
    int n, i, j, max = 0, maxp;
    
    // Scan the number of writers using format specifiers
    scanf("%d", &n);
    
    // Declare an array to store the writer's preference of people
    int a[n];
    
    // Declare an array to store the frequency of each person's name
    int person[26] = {0};
    
    // Declare a 2D array to store the writers' names
    char writer[n][26];
    
    // Loop through each writer
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        // Scan the preference of the current writer and their name
        scanf("%d %s", &a[i], writer[i]);
        
        // Loop through each character in the writer's name
        for (j = 0; j < strlen(writer[i]); j++) {
            // Increment the frequency of the person's name in the person array
            person[writer[i][j] - 'A']++;
        }
    }
    
    // Loop through each person's name
    for (i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
        // Check if the current person's name has a higher frequency than max
        if (max < person[i]) {
            // Update max and maxp to the current person's name
            max = person[i];
            maxp = i;
        }
    }
    
    // Print the person's name with the highest frequency and their maximum frequency
    printf("%c\n%d\n", maxp + 'A', max);
    
    // Loop through each writer
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        // Loop through each character in the writer's name
        for (j = 0; j < strlen(writer[i]); j++) {
            // Check if the current character matches the person's name with the highest frequency
            if (writer[i][j] == 'A' + maxp) {
                // Print the preference of the current writer
                printf("%d\n", a[i]);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Part II**

Summary:
This code is designed to find the most popular person's name among a group of writers. The program takes in the number of writers and their preferences as input, and then outputs the person's name with the highest frequency and a list of the preferences of writers who chose that person's name. The code uses two nested loops to iterate through the writers and their names, and another nested loop to compare each character in the writer's name to the person's name with the highest frequency.
