**Part II**

This program calculates the count of proper divisors for each number in a given array, and prints out the counts. The function f takes two integers x and y as input, and recursively calculates the count of proper divisors for x by dividing it by y if it is divisible, until y squared is greater than x. The main function reads the number of test cases and the numbers themselves from the input, calculates the count of proper divisors for each number, and prints it out.
