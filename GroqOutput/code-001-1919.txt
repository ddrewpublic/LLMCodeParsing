Here is the code with developer comments for each line, with a 200-word summary:

**Part I**
```c
int sum=0;// Initialize a variable to store the sum of divisors
void count(int N,int i)
{
    if(N==1) sum++;// If N is 1, increment sum
    while(i<=N){
        if(N%i==0) count(N/i,i);// If N is divisible by i, recursively call count with N/i and i
        i++;// Increment i
    }
    return ;
}
```

**Part II**

Summary:
This code calculates the sum of divisors for each number up to a certain range, specified by the user. The `count` function is a recursive function that checks if a number is divisible by another number and if it is, it calls itself with the new number and the same divisor. The `main` function reads the number of test cases from the user, and for each test case, it reads a number, calculates its sum of divisors using the `count` function, and prints the result.

```c
int main()
{
    int T=0;// Initialize a variable to store the number of test cases
    cin >> T;
    while(T--)
    {
        int N=0;// Initialize a variable to store the current number
        cin >> N;
        int i=2,total=1;// Initialize variables to store the divisor and the sum of divisors
        while(i<=N/2)
        {
            if(N%i==0)
            {
                sum = 0;
                count(N/i,i);
                total+=sum;
            }// If N is divisible by i, calculate the sum of divisors
            i++;
        }
        cout<<total<<endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Note: There is a variable named `sum` in the `main` function which is not initialized in the given code. In the code provided, it seems like the intention is to use the same `sum` variable from the function `count`, but it's not clear if this is the intended behavior.
