Part II

This code calculates the sum of divisors for a given number. The function `divide` takes two arguments, `n` and `a`, where `n` is the number for which the sum of divisors is to be calculated and `a` is the maximum divisor. The function works by recursively dividing `n` by its divisors and adding the sum of divisors of the resulting number to the sum. The function returns the sum of divisors.

In the `main` function, the user is prompted to enter a number `k`. The program then reads `k` numbers from input, calculates the sum of divisors for each number, and prints the result. The loop continues until `k` becomes 0.
