**Part II: Summary**

This code is a simple program that calculates the number of divisors of a given number. It uses a recursive function `f` that takes two arguments, `a` and `b`. The function calculates the number of divisors of `a` by iterating from `b` to the square root of `a` and recursively calling itself with `a` divided by `i` and `i` if `a` is divisible by `i`. The program reads the number of test cases and then reads each test case, calculates its number of divisors using the `f` function, and prints the result. The `main` function uses a loop to read each test case and calculates its number of divisors using the `f` function and prints the result using `cout`.
