Here is the code with developer comments added:

**Part I**
```c
int f(int a, int min); // function prototype for recursive function f
int main()
{
    int n, i, a; // declare variables n, i, and a
    cin >> n; // read an integer from input
    for(i=0; i<n; i++) { // loop n times
        cin >> a; // read an integer from input
        printf("%d\n", f(a, 2)); // call function f with a and 2 as arguments
    }
    return 0; // return 0 to indicate successful execution
}
```
**Part II: Summary**

This program reads an integer `n` from input, then reads `n` more integers and calls a recursive function `f` for each of them. The function `f` takes two arguments: an integer `a` and a minimum value `min`. It calculates the sum of all divisors of `a` except for `a` itself, starting from `min`. The result is printed to the console.

In the `main` function, we read the number of iterations `n` from input, then loop `n` times to read each integer `a` and call the `f` function with `a` and a hard-coded minimum value of 2. The results are printed to the console. The `f` function uses a recursive approach to calculate the sum of divisors, starting from the minimum value specified.
