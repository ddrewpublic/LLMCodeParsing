Here is the code with developer comments:


Part I

```
int breakways(int num, int min); // declaration of the breakways function
int main()  
{
    int n; // variable to store the number of inputs
    cin >> n; // read the number of inputs from the user
    int number; // variable to store the current number
    for (int i = 1; i <= n ; i++) // loop to read and process each number
    {
        cin >> number; // read the current number from the user
        cout << breakways(number , 2) << endl; // call the breakways function and print the result
    }
}
int breakways(int num, int min) // declaration of the breakways function
{
    int sum = 0; // variable to store the sum of ways
    for (int j = min ; j <= num ; j++) // loop to check each divisor of the number
    {
        if (num % j == 0) // check if the number is divisible by the divisor
        {
            if (num != j) // if the divisor is not equal to the number, recurse on the quotient
                sum += breakways (num / j , j); // recursive call
            else
                sum += 1; // if the divisor is equal to the number, increment the sum by 1
        }
    }
    return sum; // return the total sum of ways
}
```

Part II

This code is designed to find the total number of ways to break down a given number into its divisors, along with the sum of all such ways. The `breakways` function takes two parameters: the number to be broken down and the minimum divisor to consider.

The `main` function reads in the number of inputs from the user, and then reads in each input number and calls the `breakways` function on it with a minimum divisor of 2. The result is then printed to the console.

The `breakways` function first initializes a sum to 0, and then loops through each divisor of the number from the minimum divisor to the number itself. For each divisor, it checks if the number is divisible by the divisor. If it is, and the divisor is not equal to the number (i.e. we haven't reached the original number itself), the function calls itself recursively with the quotient and the current divisor. If the divisor is equal to the number, the function increments the sum by 1. Finally, the sum is returned.

The output of this program will be the total number of ways to break down each input number, along with the sum of all such ways.
