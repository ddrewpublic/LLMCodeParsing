```c

{
    // Initialize the variable num to 0, which will store the count of divisors
    int num=0;
    if(m>=k)

        for(int i=k;i<=m;i++)

            if(m==i) num++;

            else if(m%i==0)

                // If m is divisible by i, call the function recursively with m/i and i
                num+=division(m/i,i);

**Part II: Summary**

The provided C++ code implements a function to calculate the number of divisors of a given integer. The `division` function takes two integer parameters `m` and `k`, and returns the count of divisors of `m` that are also divisible by `k`.

In the `main` function, the program reads the value of `n` from the input stream and then iterates `n` times. In each iteration, it reads another integer value `a` from the input stream, and calls the `division` function with `a` and `2`. The result is then printed to the output stream.

The `division` function uses a recursive approach to find the divisors of `m`. It checks if `m` is divisible by the current number `i`, and if so, recursively calls itself with `m/i` and `i`. The base case of the recursion is when `m` is exactly equal to `i`, in which case it increments the count of divisors.
