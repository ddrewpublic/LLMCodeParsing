**Part I: Code with comments**

```c
main()
{
  // Define a struct called book with two fields: num (an integer) and name (an array of 26 characters)
  struct book
  {
    int num;
    char name[26];
  }b[1000];
  
  // Declare variables: m (an integer), i (an integer), j (an integer), n (an array of 26 integers), max (an integer), and t (an integer)
  int m,i,j,n[26]={0},max=0,t;
  
  // Read an integer from the input and store it in m
  scanf("%d",&m);
  
  // Loop m times, reading an integer and a string from the input for each iteration
  for(i=0;i<m;i++)
  {  scanf("%d %s",&b[i].num,b[i].name);
  }
  
  // Loop m times, examining each book
  for(i=0;i<m;i++)

  // Print the maximum value in n
  printf("%d\n",max);
  
  // Loop m times, printing the numbers of books that have the most common letter
  for(i=0;i<m;i++)

    // Loop over each character in the book's name
    for(j=0;j<strlen(b[i].name);j++)

**Part II: Summary**

This program reads a series of books from the input, where each book is described by a unique number and a name consisting of a sequence of letters. The program then determines the most common letter in all the book names, and prints the character corresponding to this letter, as well as the maximum number of times it appears. Finally, the program prints the numbers of books that contain the most common letter.
