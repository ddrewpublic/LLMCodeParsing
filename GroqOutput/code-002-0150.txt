Here is the code with developer comments:

**Part I: Code with Comments**
```c
// Define a struct to hold book information
struct book
{
    int id; // book ID
    char zz[26]; // book title (maximum 26 characters)
} b[999]; // array of 999 book structs

int main()
{
    // Initialize variables
    int m, n, i; // number of books, number of characters, loop variable
    int num[26] = {0}; // array to count the frequency of each letter
    char string[26]; // not used, possibly a leftover from an earlier version
    scanf("%d", &m); // read the number of books

    // Process each book
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++)
    {
        // Read book ID and title
        scanf("%d %s", &b[i].id, &b[i].zz);
        // Count the frequency of each letter in the title
        for (j = 0; b[i].zz[j] != '\0'; j++)
        num[b[i].zz[j] - 'A']++; // subtract the ASCII value of 'A' to get the letter index
    }

    // Find the most frequent letter
    int max = 0; // maximum frequency
    int maxz; // index of the most frequent letter
    for (i = 0; i < 26; i++)
    if (max < num[i]) { max = num[i]; maxz = i; }

    // Print the most frequent letter and IDs of books with that letter
    printf("%c\n%d", maxz + 65, max); // print the letter (A-Z) and frequency
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++)
    {
        for (j = 0; b[i].zz[j] != '\0'; j++)
        {
            // Print the IDs of books that contain the most frequent letter
            if (b[i].zz[j] == maxz + 65) printf("\n%d", b[i].id);
            else continue; // skip other letters
        }
    }
}
```

**Part II: Summary**

This program reads a list of book IDs and titles, counts the frequency of each letter in each title, and then prints the most frequently occurring letter and the IDs of books that contain that letter. The program uses a struct to hold book information and arrays to count the frequency of each letter. The main function processes each book, counts the frequency of each letter, finds the most frequent letter, and then prints the ID of each book that contains that letter. The program uses a simple loop to iterate over each book and another loop to iterate over each letter in each title.
