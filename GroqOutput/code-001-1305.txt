**Part I**

```c
int sum=0;
```
This line declares a variable named `sum` and initializes it to 0. This variable will be used to store the sum of the divisors of a number.

```c
void divide(int n,int a)
{
	for(int i=a;i<=n;i++)
	{
		if((n%i==0))
		{
			if(n/i==1)
				sum++;
			else
				divide(n/i,i);
		}
	}
}
```
This function takes two parameters, `n` and `a`, and recursively calculates the sum of the divisors of `n` that are greater than `a`.

```c
int main()
{
	int N=0,n=0,i=0;
```
This line declares three integer variables, `N`, `n`, and `i`, and initializes them to 0.

```c
	cin>>N;
```
This line reads an integer from the standard input and stores it in `N`.

```c
	for(i=0;i<N;i++)
	{
		cin>>n;
		divide(n,2);
		cout<<sum<<endl;
		sum=0;
	}
```
This loop runs `N` times. In each iteration, it reads an integer from the standard input and stores it in `n`, calls the `divide` function with `n` and 2, prints the sum, and resets the sum to 0.

```c
	return 0;
}
```
This line returns 0 to indicate successful execution of the program.

**Part II**

This C++ program reads a number of integers from the standard input and calculates the sum of the divisors for each integer. The divisors are calculated using a recursive function `divide` that recursively checks whether a number is divisible by another number. The program then prints the sum of the divisors for each integer.

The program is efficient because it uses a recursive function to calculate the divisors, which reduces the number of iterations. However, it may consume more memory stack for large input numbers due to the recursive function calls.

The program is suitable for calculating the sum of the divisors for small to medium-sized integers. For large integers, a different algorithm may be needed to reduce the memory usage and improve the efficiency.
