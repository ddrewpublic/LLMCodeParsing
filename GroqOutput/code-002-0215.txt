Here is the code with developer comments added:

**Part I**

```c
int m;
struct book
{
    char num[20];  // Structure to hold book information
    char aut[20];
    struct book*next;  // Pointer to the next book in the list
};

struct book*creat()
{
    struct book*head,*p1,*p2;  // Pointers to the head and current book
    int i;
    p1=(struct book*)malloc(LEN);  // Allocate memory for the first book
    scanf("%s %s",p1->num,p1->aut);  // Read book number and author from input
    p1->next=NULL;  // Set the next pointer to NULL
    head=p1;  // Set the head of the list to the first book
    p2=p1;
    for(i=1;i<m;i++)  // Loop to add m-1 more books
    {
        p1=(struct book*)malloc(LEN);  // Allocate memory for the next book
        scanf("%s %s",p1->num,p1->aut);  // Read book number and author from input
        p1->next=NULL;  // Set the next pointer to NULL
        p2->next=p1;  // Set the next pointer of the current book to the new book
        p2=p1;  // Move the current book pointer to the new book
    }
    return(head);  // Return the head of the list
}
```

**Part II**

Here is a 200-word summary of the code:

The code is a C program that creates a linked list of books and then prints out the most frequent author and the corresponding book titles. The program first reads the number of books (m) from the input, then creates a linked list of books. Each book is represented by a struct book, which has fields for book number, author, and a pointer to the next book in the list.

The creat() function is used to create the linked list. It takes as input the number of books (m) and returns the head of the list. The function first reads the first book from the input and sets it as the head of the list. Then, it loops (m-1) times to read and add the remaining books to the list.

The print() function is used to print the most frequent author and the corresponding book titles. It first calculates the frequency of each author in the list using an array to count the occurrences of each author. Then, it identifies the author with the highest frequency and prints out the corresponding book titles.
