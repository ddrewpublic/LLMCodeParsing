And here is a 200-word summary using the header "Part II":

**Part II**

This program is designed to find the sum of divisors for a given integer. The `f` function is a recursive function that takes two parameters `x` and `i`, and finds the sum of divisors of `x`. The function increments the sum by 1 if `x` is equal to 1, otherwise it loops through all divisors of `x` and recursively calls itself with `x/i` as the new value for `x`.

In the `main` function, the program reads an integer value from the input stream and initiates a loop that runs for each input value. Inside the loop, the program reads another integer value from the input stream and finds the sum of its divisors using the `f` function. The sum is then printed to the output stream. The loop counter is decremented at the end of each iteration.

The program is designed to efficiently find the sum of divisors for each integer, with the recursive function allowing for the rapid exploration of divisor relationships. The use of a loop to iterate through all primes less than the square root of `x` also helps to speed up the calculation by avoiding unnecessary checks for larger divisors.
