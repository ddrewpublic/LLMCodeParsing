Here is the code with comments and a summary:

**Part I**
```
int cal;  // integer variable to store the factorial count

int fac(int a, int x){  // function to calculate the factorial of a number 'x' up to 'a'
    if(x==1) { cal++; return 1; }  // base case: if 'x' is 1, increment the factorial count and return 1
    for(int i=2;i<=x;i++)
        if(x%i==0&&i>=a)  // loop through numbers from 2 to 'x', and if 'x' is divisible by 'i' and 'i' is greater than or equal to 'a'
            fac(i, x/i);  // recursive call to calculate the factorial of the remaining value
}

int main(){
    int n, b;
    cin>>n;  // read the number of test cases
    while(n>0){
        cal=0;  // reset the factorial count
        cin>>b;  // read the number to calculate the factorial
        fac(1, b);  // call the factorial function
        cout<<cal<<endl;  // print the factorial count
        n--;  // decrement the number of test cases
    }
}
```

**Part II**

This code calculates the factorial of a given number up to a certain number, and counts the number of times the base case is reached. The function `fac` takes two arguments, `a` and `x`, where `a` is the lower bound for the factorial calculation and `x` is the number to calculate the factorial of. The function uses a recursive approach to calculate the factorial, looping through numbers from 2 to `x` and recursively calling itself until the base case (`x` is 1) is reached. The `main` function reads the number of test cases and the number to calculate the factorial, calls the `fac` function, and prints the resulting factorial count.
