Part II

This program calculates the most frequent letter in the authors' names of a set of books. It prompts the user to input the number of books and the book information (number and author name). Then, it calculates the frequency of each letter in the authors' names and finds the letter with the maximum frequency. Finally, it prints the letter and the ASCII value of the letter, as well as the numbers of books with this letter in their authors' names.

The program uses a struct to store the book information, and it dynamically allocates memory for an array of this struct. It uses two for loops to read the book information from the user. The program then calculates the frequency of each letter in the authors' names by subtracting the ASCII value of 'A' from the ASCII value of each letter and comparing it with the ASCII values of 'A' to 'Z'. The most frequent letter is found by comparing the frequencies of the letters, and the program prints the result.

The program is a simple implementation of frequency analysis. It can be used to analyze the frequency of letters in a set of texts and identify the most common letters.
