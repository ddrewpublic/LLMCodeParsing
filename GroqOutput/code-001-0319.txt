**Part I: Code**

```c
int f(int a, int min) // Function to calculate the number of divisors of a number
{
    int i;
    if(a < min) // Base case: if a is less than the minimum divisor, return 0
    { 
        return 0; 
    } 
    int result = 1; // Initialize result to 1, since 1 is always a divisor
    for(int i = min; i < a; i++) // Loop from minimum divisor to a
    { 
        if(a % i == 0) // Check if a is divisible by the current number
        { 
            result += f(a/i, i); // Recursively call f with a/i and the current number
        } 
    } 
    return result; 
}

int main()
{
    int n, a; // Initialize variables
    cin>>n; // Read the number of inputs
    while(cin>>a) // Loop until all inputs are read
    {
        cout<<f(a, 2)<<endl; // Call f with a and 2, and print the result
    }
    return 0;
}
```

**Part II: Summary**

This C++ program calculates the number of divisors of each number in a sequence of inputs. The `f` function takes an integer `a` and an integer `min` as input, and returns the number of divisors of `a` that are greater than or equal to `min`. The function uses a recursive approach to find the divisors, starting from the minimum divisor and incrementing by 1 until it reaches `a`. The `main` function reads a sequence of integers from input, and for each integer, it calls the `f` function with the integer and the minimum divisor `2`, and prints the result.
