Here is the code with developer comments for each line, and also a 200-word summary:

**Part I: Code with comments**

```c
int main() {
    // declare an array to store the count of each character
    int num[27] = {0}, no[27][1000] = {0};
    // declare a string to store the input string
    char s[27];
    // declare a single character
    char ls;
    // declare several variables
    int l, i, max, t, j, flag, n, w;
    // read the number of test cases
    cin >> t;
    for (i = 1; i <= t; i++) {
        // read the string length and the string itself
        cin >> n >> s;
        // get the length of the string
        l = strlen(s);
        for (j = 0; j <= l - 1; j++) {
            // convert the character to a number (A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26)
            w = s[j] - 'A' + 1;
            // increment the count of this character
            num[w]++;
            // store the string index for this character
            no[w][num[w]] = n;
        }
    }
    // find the maximum frequency and the corresponding character
    max = 0;
    for (i = 1; i <= 26; i++)
        if (num[i] > max) {
            max = num[i];
            flag = i;
        }
    // convert the character back to its ASCII form
    ls = (char) 64 + flag;
    // print the character and its count
    cout << ls << endl << num[flag] << endl;
    // print each string corresponding to this character
    for (i = 1; i <= num[flag]; i++)
        cout << no[flag][i] << endl;
    // read some extra information for testing purposes
    cin >> w;
    return 0;
}
```

**Part II: Summary**

This program reads a set of strings and outputs the most frequently appearing character and the strings that contain it. Each string is represented by a number, and each character is converted to a number from 1 to 26 (A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26). The program then counts the frequency of each character and stores the strings that contain each character. Finally, it finds the character with the highest frequency and outputs it along with the corresponding strings.
