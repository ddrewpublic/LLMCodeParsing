Here's the code with developer comments:
```
Part I:

int multiply(int a, int b) {
    // Initialize variables i, n, and sum
    int i = 0, n = 0, sum = 1;

    // Check if b is less than a
    if (a < b)
        return 0;
    else {
        // Start a loop that runs for each multiple of b up to a
        for (i = b; i <= a; i++) {
            // Check if a is divisible by i
            if (a % i == 0) {
                // Recursively call the multiply function with a divided by i and i
                sum = sum + multiply(a / i, i);
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}

Part II: Summary

The given code is written in C++ and it seems to be intended to solve a problem related to multiplying numbers. Here's a summary of the code:

* The function `multiply` takes two integers, `a` and `b`, and returns their product. 
* The function checks if `b` is less than `a`, and if so, it returns 0. 
* Otherwise, it initializes a variable `sum` to 1 and then iterates over all multiples of `b` that are less than or equal to `a`. 
* For each such multiple `i`, it checks if `a` is divisible by `i` and if so, it recursively calls `multiply` with `a` divided by `i` and `i` and adds the return value to `sum`. 
* After the loop, it returns the final value of `sum`.

* The main function reads an integer `n` from the input and then reads `n` numbers and calculates their multiplication by 2. 
* It stores the results in an array `result` and then prints out each result.
