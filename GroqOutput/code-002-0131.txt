**Part I**

```
struct book
{
    int id;
    char author[26];
};
```

* Defines a struct called `book` with two members: an integer `id` and a character array `author` of size 26.

```
int main()
{
    struct book b[999]; 
    int a[26];
    int m,i,j,max,maxauthor;
    char c;
```

* Declares the main function and initializes several variables: an array of `book` structs `b` with a size of 999, an array `a` of size 26, and three integer variables `m`, `max`, and `maxauthor`. Also declares a character variable `c`.

```
    scanf("%d",&m);
```

* Reads an integer value from the standard input and stores it in the variable `m`.

```
    for (i=0;i<m;i++)
    {
        scanf("%d %s",&b[i].id,b[i].author);
    }
```

* Loops through `m` times and reads an integer value and a string of up to 26 characters from the standard input. Stores the integer value in the `id` field and the string in the `author` field of the respective elements of the `b` array.

**Part II**

This program reads a series of `book` records from the standard input, where each record contains an integer `id` and a string `author` of up to 26 characters. The program then tallies the frequency of each author's last name, and prints the author with the most frequent last name. Finally, it prints the IDs of all books written by that author.

The program uses a 26-element array `a` to store the frequency of each author's last name, where the index of the array corresponds to the ASCII value of the first letter of each author's last name (i.e., 'A' corresponds to index 0, 'B' corresponds to index 1, and so on). The `scanf` statement reads the integer and string values from the input and stores them in the respective elements of the `b` array. The program then iterates through each element of the `b` array and calculates the frequency of each author's last name by iterating through the characters of the `author` string and incrementing the corresponding element of the `a` array. The program then finds the maximum frequency value and the corresponding author's last name, and prints the results.
