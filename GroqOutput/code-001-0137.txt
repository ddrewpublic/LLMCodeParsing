Here is the code with developer comments and a summary:

**Part I**

```c
int factor(int a,int min)
{
    // Initialize a variable to count the number of factors of 'a'
    int count=0;
    for(int i=min;i<=a;i++)
    {
        // If the current number is equal to 'a', it means we have found a factor
        if(i==a)
        {
            count+=1;
        }
        // If 'a' is divisible by the current number, it means we have found another factor
        if(a%i==0)
        {
            // Recursively call the function to find more factors
            count+=factor(a/i,i);
        }
    }
    // Return the total count of factors
    return count;
}
```

**Part II**
Summary:

The code is designed to find the number of factors of a given integer 'a'. The function `factor` takes two parameters, 'a' and 'min', where 'min' is the starting point for the iteration. The function uses a recursive approach to find the factors of 'a'. For each number 'i' starting from 'min' and up to 'a', it checks if 'a' is divisible by 'i'. If it is, it means 'i' is a factor of 'a', so it increments the count. If 'i' is equal to 'a', it means 'i' is the last factor, so it also increments the count. The function then recursively calls itself with the newly calculated 'a' and the same 'i' to find more factors. The function returns the total count of factors. The main function reads an integer 'n' and then reads 'n' integers. For each integer 'a', it calls the `factor` function with 'a' and 'min' set to 2, and prints the result.
