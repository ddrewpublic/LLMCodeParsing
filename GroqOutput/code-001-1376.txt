```c

int main()

**Part II**

This program is designed to calculate the sum of all divisors of a given number. The user is asked to enter the number of elements they want to process, followed by the elements themselves. For each element, the program calculates the sum of all its divisors, excluding 1 and the number itself, and prints the result. The function `f` is used to calculate the sum of divisors, which is done recursively by dividing the number by each divisor and adding the sum of the divisors of the result to the current sum. The main function reads the input, calls the function `f` for each element, and prints the results.
