**Part II: 200-word Summary**

This program reads the details of several books, including their IDs and titles. It then counts the frequency of each letter in each title and finds the letter with the maximum frequency. The ID of the book with the maximum frequency is then printed. The program uses three functions: `number_of_books` to count the frequency of each letter, `max` to find the letter with the maximum frequency, and `name_of_book` to print the ID of the book with the maximum frequency. The program uses a dynamically allocated array `p` to store the counts of each letter, with indices ranging from 65 (the ASCII code for 'A') to 91 (the ASCII code for 'Z'). The program assumes that the input titles only contain letters and do not exceed 27 characters.
