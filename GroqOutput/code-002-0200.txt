**Part I**
```c
void main() {
	// Define a structure called book to store the book details
	struct book {
		char num[100], wri[26]; // num is the book number, wri is the writer of the book
	} bo[1000]; // bo is an array of 1000 books
	int i, j, k, l, n, m = 0, a[26] = {0}, mw; // declare several variables


	// Read the number of books
	scanf("%d\n", &n);

	// Loop through each book
	for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		// Read the book number and writer
		scanf("%s %s", bo[i].num, bo[i].wri);

		// Find the length of the writer's name
		l = strlen(bo[i].wri);

		// Count the frequency of each character in the writer's name
		for (j = 0; j < l; j++) a[bo[i].wri[j] - 65]++;

	}
```

**Part II**

The program reads a number of books and stores their details in an array called `bo`. Then it counts the frequency of each character in the writer's name of each book, and finds the most frequent character. It then prints the number of occurrences of the most frequent character and finally prints the book number of the book which has this character in its writer's name. The character count is case-insensitive, so 'a' or 'A' is considered as same.
