**Part II: Summary**

The program calculates the number of ways to divide a given number 'm' into at least 'n' non-negative integers, including zero. It uses a recursive function 'f(m, n)' to achieve this. The function returns 0 if 'm' is less than 'n' or if it cannot be divided into at least 'n' non-negative integers. Otherwise, it returns the sum of the number of ways to divide 'm/n' into at least 'n' non-negative integers, plus the number of ways to divide 'm' into at least 'n+1' non-negative integers, plus 1.

The main function reads an integer 'q' from input and iterates 'q' times. In each iteration, it reads another integer 'p' and outputs the number of ways to divide 'p' into at least 2 non-negative integers, plus 1. The program then exits.
