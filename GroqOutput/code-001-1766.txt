Here is the code with developer comments:

Part I
```
int f(int x,int y) {
    // Base case: if y is equal to x, return 1
    if(y==x)
        return 1; 
    // Base case: if y is greater than x, return 0
    if(y>x)
        return 0;
    // Recursive case: if x is divisible by y, return the sum of the recursive calls
    if(x%y==0)
        return f(x,y+1)+f(x/y,y);
    // Recursive case: if x is not divisible by y, return the recursive call with y incremented by 1
    else
        return f(x,y+1);
}
```

```
int main() {
    // Declare integer variable n and read input value from user
    int n,x;
    cin>>n;
    // Declare integer variables z and i, and initialize i with the value of n
    int z,i;
    i=n;
    // Loop until i becomes 0
    while(i>0) {
        // Decrement i by 1
        i=i-1;
        // Read input value x from user
        cin>>x;
        // Call the function f with parameters x and 2, and assign the result to z
        z=f(x,2);
        // Print the value of z to the screen
        cout<<z<<endl;
    }
    // Return 0 to indicate successful execution
    return 0;
}
```

Part II
This program is a simple implementation of the Collatz Conjecture, also known as the 3x+1 problem. The conjecture is a mathematical idea proposed by Lothar Collatz in the 1930s, which suggests that starting with any positive integer, repeatedly applying a simple transformation, the sequence will always reach 1. The transformation is: if the number is even, divide it by 2, otherwise, multiply it by 3 and add 1.
