**Part I**

```c
int divide(int n,int j)
{
    // Function to find the sum of divisors of a number
    int sum=1,i,s,p,k;
    s=sqrt(n);
    // Loop through all numbers from j to the square root of n
    for(i=j;i<=s;i++)
    {
        // Check if the number is divisible by i
        if (n%i==0)
        {
            // If divisible, calculate the quotient and keep track of the divisor
            p=n/i;
            k=i;
            // Recursively call the function to add the sum of divisors of the quotient
            sum=sum+divide(p,i);
        }
    }
    // Return the sum of divisors
    return sum;
}

int main()
{
    // Get a number from the user input
    int n;
    cin>>n;
    // Initialize variables for the loop
    int k,m,p;
    // Loop through all numbers from 0 to n-1
    for(k=0;k<n;k++)
    {
        // Get a number from the user input
        cin>>m;
        // Calculate the sum of divisors of the number starting from 2
        p=divide(m,2);
        // Print the sum of divisors
        cout<<p<<endl;
    }
    // Return 0 to indicate successful execution
    return 0;
}
```

**Part II**

This program is designed to calculate the sum of divisors of a number. The `divide` function takes two arguments, `n` and `j`, and returns the sum of divisors of `n` starting from `j`. The function uses a loop to iterate through all numbers from `j` to the square root of `n`, and for each number, it checks if `n` is divisible by it. If it is, the function recursively calls itself to add the sum of divisors of the quotient. The `main` function first gets a number from the user input, then loops through all numbers from 0 to `n-1`, getting each number from the user input and calculating the sum of divisors starting from 2. The program finally prints the sum of divisors for each number.
