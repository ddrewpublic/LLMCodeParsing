**Part I**

```c
int f(int,int);      // Function prototype declaration for f(int, int)
int main( )      // Main function declaration
{      // Start of the main function
    int n,i,a[50];  // Declare integer variable n, loop variable i, and array a of size 50
    cin >>n;      // Read an integer from standard input and store it in n
    for(i=0;i<n;i++){
        cin >>a[i];      // Read an integer from standard input and store it in a[i]
        cout <<f(a[i],2) <<endl;      // Call the function f(a[i], 2) and print the result
    }
    return 0;      // Return 0 to indicate successful program execution
}      // End of the main function
```

**Part II**

This code is a simple implementation of a function to calculate the number of proper divisors of a given integer. The `f` function takes two integer parameters, `n` and `p`, and returns the sum of the proper divisors of `n` excluding `p`.

The `main` function reads an integer `n` from the standard input, and for each integer from 0 to `n`, it reads the integer into an array `a`. Then, for each integer in the array, it calls the `f` function with the integer and 2 as parameters, and prints the result.

The `f` function uses a recursive approach to calculate the sum of the proper divisors. It starts with the smallest possible divisor, `p`, and checks if `n` is divisible by `p`. If `n` is divisible by `p`, it adds the divisor and its corresponding number of proper divisors (calculated recursively) to the sum. Finally, it returns the sum of all proper divisors.
