**Part I: Code**

```c
int divide(int d, int n)
{
    // Initialize the sum variable to 0
    int sum = 0;
    // Loop through all numbers from d to n-1
    for(int i = d; i < n; i++){
        // Check if i is a divisor of n and the quotient is greater than or equal to i
        if (n % i == 0 && (n / i) >= i){
            // If the condition is true, increment the sum by 1
            sum = sum + 1;
            // Recursively call the function with i as the new value of d and n/i as the new value of n
            sum = sum + divide(i, n / i);
        }
    }
    // Return the total sum
    return (sum);
}
```

**Part II: Summary**

The given C++ code solves the problem of finding the number of divisors for a given set of numbers. The `divide` function takes two integers, `d` and `n`, as input and returns the number of divisors of `n` that are greater than or equal to `d`. The `main` function reads a number `n` and `n` numbers from the input, then calls the `divide` function for each number with `d` set to 2 and prints the result. The code uses a recursive approach to find the divisors, which may lead to inefficiencies for large input values. A more efficient solution would be to use a loop to find the divisors and avoid the recursive function calls.
