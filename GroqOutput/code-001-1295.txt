```c

// takes two int arguments and returns an int
int f(int, int);

int main()

    // Declare integer variables x, n, and i
    int x, n, i;

        cin >> x;
        // Call function f() with x and 2 as arguments and print the result
        cout << f(x, 2) << endl;

                // If true, recursively call f() with x divided by i and i as arguments, and add the result to ans
                ans = ans + f(x / i, i);
            }

**Part II: 200-word Summary**

This C++ code calculates the prime factors of a given number using the recursive function f(). The main function takes an integer n as input from the user and then iterates n times, reading another integer x each time and calling the f() function with x and 2 as arguments. The f() function calculates the number of prime factors of x and returns the result. If x is equal to 2, the function returns 1, as 2 is a prime number. Otherwise, the function recursively breaks down x into smaller factors until it finds a prime number, adding the results to a running total. The final result includes 1 as the number of prime factors of 1. The code uses the standard input/output streams cin and cout, respectively, for reading and writing data. The sqrt() function is used to calculate the square root of x. The code is well-structured and easy to follow, with clear variable names and descriptive comments.
