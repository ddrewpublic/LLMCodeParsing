Here is the code with developer comments:

```
// Part I

int c[1000] = {0}, // An array to store the count of prime factors for each number
       d[1000], // An array to store the numbers
       j; // A variable to iterate over the arrays

main() {
    // Declare a function f that will be called recursively
    void f();

    int i, // A variable to iterate over the array
        s; // A variable to store the input number
    // Read the input number s
    scanf("%d", &s);

    // Iterate over the input number s
    for (j = 0; j < s; j++) {
        // Read the jth number from the input
        scanf("%d", &d[j]);

        // Iterate from 2 to the square root of the jth number
        for (i = 2; i <= sqrt(d[j]); i++) {
            // Check if the jth number is divisible by i
            if (d[j] % i == 0) {
                // Increment the count of prime factors for the jth number
                c[j]++;
                // Call the function f recursively with the divisors of the jth number
                f(i, d[j] / i);
            }
        }
    }

    // Iterate over the input number s again
    for (j = 0; j < s; j++) {
        // Print the count of prime factors for the jth number plus 1
        printf("%d\n", c[j] + 1);
    }
}

// Define the function f
void f(int s, int m) {
    // Iterate from s to the square root of m
    int k;
    for (k = s; k <= sqrt(m); k++) {
        // Check if m is divisible by k
        if (m % k == 0) {
            // Increment the count of prime factors for the jth number
            c[j]++;
            // Call the function f recursively with the divisors of m
            f(k, m / k);
        }
    }
}
```

Here is the summary:

**Part II**

This program aims to count the number of prime factors for each number in the input. The program uses a bottom-up approach to find the prime factors of each number. The main function takes an integer s as input, and then iterates over an array of s numbers. For each number, it finds its prime factors by checking divisibility from 2 to the square root of the number. The function f is called recursively to find the prime factors of the divisors. Finally, the program prints the count of prime factors for each number, incremented by 1.
