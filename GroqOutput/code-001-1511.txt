**Part II: Summary**

This code is written in C programming language and is used to find the value of a mathematical function f(n,m) for a given input. The function f(n,m) calculates the sum of the totient values of all positive integers less than or equal to n that are divisible by m. The totient function Ï†(n) is an arithmetic function that counts the positive integers up to n that are relatively prime to n. The code also has a main function that reads the input values from the user and then calls the f(n,m) function for each value, printing the output.

Here is the code with developer comments for each line:

```

int f(int n,int m)
// Function f(n,m) calculates the sum of the totient values of all positive integers less than or equal to n that are divisible by m.
{
int sum=1,i;
// Initialize sum to 1 and i.
if(n<m)
// If n is less than m, then the function should return 0.
    sum=0;
else 
// If n is greater than or equal to m.
    if(n==m)
        sum=1;
// If n is equal to m, then the function should return 1.
else 
// If n is greater than m.
{
    for(i=m;i<=n;i++)
        // Loop through all numbers from m to n.
        if(n%i==0)
            // If the number is divisible by n, then calculate its totient value.
            sum=sum+f(n/i,i);
// Recursive call to f(n/m,i) to calculate the totient value.
}
// Return the calculated sum.
return(sum);
}

void main()
// Function main() is the entry point of the program.
{
int x,j,a[100000];
// Declare variables x, j and array a of size 100000.
scanf("%d",&x);
// Read the number of test cases from the user.
for(j=0;j<x;j++)
    // Loop through each test case.
    scanf("%d",&a[j]);
// Read the numbers for each test case from the user.
for(j=0;j<x;j++)
    // Loop through each test case again to print the output.
    printf("%d\n",f(a[j],2));
// Call the function f(a[j],2) for each test case and print the output.
