**Part I**

```c
int n, a, cnt = 0, num;
```

* Declaration of variables: `n` to store the number of inputs, `a` to store the current input number, `cnt` to count the number of inputs, and `num` to store the result of the decomposition function.

```c
int decompose(int x, int y)
{
```

* Declaration of the `decompose` function, which takes two integer parameters `x` and `y`.

```c
    int i, xnum = 1;
```

* Initialization of variables: `i` to be used as a loop counter, and `xnum` to store the number of divisors of `x`. It is initialized to 1, as every number has at least one divisor (1 itself).

```c
    if(x == 1)
        return 0;
```

* Base case: if `x` is 1, the function returns 0, as 1 has no divisors other than 1.

```c
    if(x == 2)
        return 1;
```

* Base case: if `x` is 2, the function returns 1, as 2 has one divisor (2).

```c
    for(i = y; i <= (int)sqrt(x); i++)
```

* Loop to iterate through numbers from `y` to the square root of `x`.

```c
        if(x % i == 0)
            xnum += decompose(x / i, i);
```

* If `i` is a divisor of `x`, the function recursively calls itself with `x` divided by `i` and `i` as new arguments, and adds the result to `xnum`.

```c
    return xnum;
}
```

* Return the total number of divisors for `x`.

**Part II**

This program is designed to calculate the number of divisors for each number in a sequence of inputs, up to a specified number `n`. The `decompose` function recursively calculates the number of divisors for each number by iteratively finding its divisors up to the square root of the number, and recursively calling itself to find the divisors of the divisors. The `main` function reads the input numbers, calls the `decompose` function to calculate their divisors, and prints the results. The program continues until it has processed `n` inputs.
