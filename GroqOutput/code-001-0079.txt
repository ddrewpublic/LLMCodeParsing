**Part II**

This code is for calculating the sum of prime factors of a given number. It uses a recursive approach to find the sum. The function `func` takes two parameters: `m`, the number for which we want to find the sum of prime factors, and `q`, the starting number for finding prime factors. The function returns the sum of prime factors.

In the main function, we read the number of test cases `n`, then read and calculate the sum of prime factors for each test case, and finally print the results.

The code is designed to efficiently find the sum of prime factors by breaking early from the loop when the square of the current number exceeds `m`, since any larger factor would be a multiple of a smaller factor already found. If there are more than 2 prime factors or if `p` is non-zero and `m` is not 2, the function recursively calls itself with `m` divided by the current prime factor and the current prime factor itself. If there are only 2 prime factors or `m` is 2, the function returns 1.
