**Part I**

```
int main(){
  // Declare a function pointer to the function hanshu with two integer parameters
  int hanshu(int k,int min);
  
  int n, i, a;
  
  // Read an integer value from the user
  scanf("%d",&n);
  
  // Loop through the input value
  for(i=0;i<n;i++){
      // Read an integer value from the user
      scanf("%d",&a);
      // Print the result of calling the function hanshu with a and 2
      printf("%d\n",hanshu(a,2));
     }
  
  // Read another integer value from the user
  scanf("%d",&n);
  
  // Return 0 to indicate successful execution
  return 0;
}
```

**Part II**

Summary:

The code consists of a main function that reads an integer array from the user, and then calls a helper function Hanshu to calculate the result. The function Hanshu takes two integers as input: the number k and the minimum value min. If k is less than min, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it loops through all the numbers from min to k/j (inclusive), where j is the current number. If k is divisible by j, it recursively calls Hanshu with k/j and j, and adds the result to a variable b. The function finally returns b.

The main function loops through the input array, reads each number, and calls Hanshu with that number and 2. It then prints the result. For example, if the user inputs [6,2,3], the output would be [6,2,3].
