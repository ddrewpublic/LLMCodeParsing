**Part I**
```
int sum=0; // initialize sum to 0
void f(int n,int y)
{
  int a=sqrt(n); // calculate the square root of n
  for(int i=y;i<=a;i++)
  {
    if(n%i==0) // check if n is divisible by i
    {
      sum++; // increment sum if n is divisible by i
      y=i; // update y to be the current value of i
      f(n/i,y); // recursively call f with n/i and y
    }
  }
}
```

**Part II**

This program calculates the number of prime factors for each number in an input array. The function `f` takes two parameters: `n` (the number to be factored) and `y` (the starting point for the factorization).

Here's a summary of how the program works:

* The program starts by initializing the `sum` variable to 0, which will store the number of prime factors for each number.
* The function `f` recursively calculates the prime factors of a number `n` starting from a given `y`.
* It does this by iterating from `y` to the square root of `n`, and checking if `n` is divisible by each number in this range.
* If `n` is divisible by a number `i`, it increments the `sum` and updates `y` to be the current value of `i`, then recursively calls itself with `n/i` and `y`.
* The main function reads an array of numbers from the user, and for each number, it calls `f` with the number and 2 as the starting point (since 2 is the smallest prime number), and prints the sum plus 1 (since the program doesn't count 1 as a prime factor).
