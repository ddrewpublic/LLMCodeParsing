**Part I: Code with Developer Comments**

```cpp
// This function calculates the number of factors for a given integer.
// Input: an integer.
void FenJie(int x)
{
    int i, temp = Befor; // Initialize a temporary variable to store the previous value of Befor.

    // Base case: If the number is 1, increment the counter and return.
    if (x == 1)
    {
        counter++;
        return;
    }

    // Loop until x is greater than 1.
    for (i = Befor; i > 1; i--) // Iterate from Befor down to 1.
    {
        // Check if x is divisible by i.
        if (x % i == 0)
        {
            // If x is divisible by i, update Befor to i and recursively call FenJie with x/i.
            Befor = i;
            FenJie(x / i);
        }
        // Update Befor to the temporary value to backtrack.
        Befor = temp;
    }
    return;
}

int main()
{
    int n, x, i; // Initialize variables to store the number of inputs, the current input, and a counter.
    cin >> n; // Read the number of inputs.
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) // Loop through each input.
    {
        cin >> x; // Read the current input.
        counter = 0; // Reset the counter for each input.
        Befor = x; // Initialize Befor to the current input.
        FenJie(x); // Call FenJie with the current input.
        cout << counter << endl; // Print the number of factors for the current input.
    }

}
```

**Part II: Summary**

This code calculates the number of factors for a given sequence of integers. The `FenJie` function takes an integer as input and recursively calculates the number of factors by dividing the input by a number and calling itself until the input is reduced to 1. The `main` function reads a sequence of integers, calls `FenJie` for each integer, and prints the number of factors for each integer. The code uses a temporary variable `Befor` to store the previous value of `Befor` to backtrack during the recursive process.
