**Part II**

Summary:
This C++ program is designed to decompose a given number into its prime factors. The program consists of a main function that reads input numbers from the user, and a decompose function that breaks down the input number into its prime factors. The decompose function uses a recursive approach to find the prime factors, starting from the square root of the input number and iterating downwards. The program outputs the sum of the prime factors for each input number.
