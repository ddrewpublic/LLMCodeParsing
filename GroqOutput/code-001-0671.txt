Here is the code with developer comments added for each line:

**Part I**

```cpp
// ????.cpp : ??????????????
```

This is a comment at the top of the file, noting the filename and stating that the purpose of the file is unknown.

```cpp
int f(int x,int y)
{
```

This is the definition of a function called `f` that takes two integer parameters, `x` and `y`.

```cpp
    int i,a=1;
```

This initializes two variables: `i` to an integer and `a` to 1.

```cpp
    if(x<y) return 0;
```

This checks if `x` is less than `y`, and if so, returns 0.

```cpp
    if(x==y) return 1;
```

This checks if `x` is equal to `y`, and if so, returns 1.

```cpp
    if(x>y)
    {
```

This checks if `x` is greater than `y`.

```cpp
        if(y==1)
        {
            for(i=y+1;i<=x;i++)
            {
                if(x%i==0) a=a+f(x/i,i);
            }
        }
```

This is a nested if statement that checks if `y` is equal to 1, and if so, enters a loop that checks if `x` is divisible by the current value of `i`, and if so, recursively calls the `f` function with `x` divided by `i` and `i` as parameters.

```cpp
        else
        {
            for(i=y;i<=x;i++)
            {
                if(x%i==0) a=a+f(x/i,i);
            }
        }
```

This is another loop that checks if `x` is divisible by the current value of `i`, and if so, recursively calls the `f` function with `x` divided by `i` and `i` as parameters.

```cpp
        return a;
    }
```

This returns the value of `a`.

```cpp
}
```

This closes the `f` function definition.

**Part II**

This code is a C++ program that implements a function `f(x,y)` that calculates the number of divisors of `x` (excluding `x` itself and 1). The program reads input from the user, calculates the number of divisors for each input, and prints the results.

The program starts by defining the function `f(x,y)` as described above. It then defines the main function `main()`, which reads input from the user and calls the `f()` function for each input.

The input is stored in the variable `p`, and the program loops `p` times, reading an integer `n` each time and printing the result of calling `f(n,1)`.

The program then returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
