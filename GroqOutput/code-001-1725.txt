**Part I**

```c
int i,n,k;
```

* Declare three integer variables: `i`, `n`, and `k`.

```c
int work(int p,int n)
{
	if (n==1) k++;
```

* Define a recursive function `work` that takes two integer arguments `p` and `n`. If `n` is equal to 1, increment the value of `k`.

```c
	for (int i=p;i<=n;i++)
```

* Start a loop that iterates from `p` to `n` (inclusive).

```c
		if (n%i==0) work(i,n/i);
```

* Check if `n` is divisible by `i`. If it is, recursively call `work` with `i` as the new `p` and `n/i` as the new `n`.

```c
int main()
```

**Part II**

Summary:

This code is a solution to a common programming problem that involves counting the number of prime factors for a given number. The program uses a recursive function called `work` to count the number of prime factors of a given number `n`. The function works by checking if `n` is divisible by any number from `p` to `n` (inclusive), and if it is, recursively calling itself with the quotient of `n` and the divisor as new values for `p` and `n` respectively.

```c
{
	int m;
```

* Declare an integer variable `m` to store the number of test cases.

```c
	cin>>m;
```

* Read the value of `m` from the standard input.

```c
	while (m>0)
```

* Start a loop that runs until `m` becomes zero.

```c
		{
    	cin>>n;
    	k=0;
    	work(2,n);
```

* Read a number `n` from the standard input.
* Initialize the value of `k` to zero.
* Call the `work` function with `2` as the initial value for `p` and `n` as the number for which we want to count the prime factors.

```c
					cout<<k<<endl;
```

* Print the value of `k` (the number of prime factors) to the standard output, followed by a newline character.

```c
					m--;
```

* Decrement the value of `m` by one.

```c
		}
```

* End of the inner loop.

```c
	return 0;
}
```

* Return `0` to indicate that the program has executed successfully.

Note:

This code is not efficient for large numbers as it involves a lot of repeated calculations. The time complexity is exponential because the function is recursive and it calls itself for each factor of the number.
