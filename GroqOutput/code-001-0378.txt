**Part II: Summary**

This is a C++ program that calculates the total number of solutions for a given input value a, where the solution number is based on the parameters n and c. The program uses a recursive function called solutionnumber to calculate the total number of solutions.

The solutionnumber function takes two integer arguments n and c, and returns an integer value representing the total number of solutions. The function returns 1 when n is equal to c, 0 when n is less than c, and recursively calls itself when n is divisible by c. This process continues until n is no longer divisible by c.

The main function reads input values from the console and calls the solutionnumber function with the input values and a fixed value of 2. The program then prints the result of the solutionnumber function and decrements the input value N until it reaches 0.

Overall, this program demonstrates a basic example of recursion in C++ and can be used to solve problems that involve finding the total number of solutions based on given parameters.
