**Part II:**

This code is for solving a problem related to finding the number of prime factors in a given number. It calculates the sum of all factors of a given number and prints it. The function f is a recursive function that finds all the factors of a number and increments the sum. The while loop continues to take input numbers and calls the function f until the input number becomes 0. The variable sum is initialized to 1 and is incremented each time a factor is found. The function f is called with the start value 2 and the number to be factorized. The square root of a is used as the upper limit for the loop to avoid repeated iterations.
