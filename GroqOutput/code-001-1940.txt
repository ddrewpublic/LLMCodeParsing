**Part II**

The code implements a recursive function `fj` to calculate the number of proper divisors for a given integer `m`. The function takes two integer parameters `m` and `i`, where `i` is the starting point for the divisor search.

In the `main` function, the code reads an integer `n` from the input, and then loops through a range of `n` iterations. In each iteration, it reads an integer `m` from the input, makes a recursive call to function `fj` with `m` and 2 as arguments, prints the value of `num`, and then resets `num` to 0.

The function `fj` uses a recursive approach to find the number of proper divisors for `m`. If `m` is 1, it increments the value of `num`. Otherwise, it loops through the range from `i` to `m`, checks if `m` is divisible by `j`, and if so, makes a recursive call to `fj` with `m/j` and `j` as arguments. The function returns the number of divisors for `m` after traversing all possible divisors.
