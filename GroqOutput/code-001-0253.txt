Here is the code with developer comments:

**Part I: Code**

```c
int m=2;
int manners(int a){ // Function to find the number of divisors of a given number
    int count=1,t=0;
    t=sqrt((double) a); // Find the square root of the number to limit the loop
    for(int i=m;i<=t;i++){ // Loop through all numbers from 2 to the square root of the number
        if(a%i==0){ // If the number is divisible by the current number
            m=i; // Update the divisor to the current number
            count=count+manners(a/i); // Recursively call the function for the remainder
        }
    }
    return count; // Return the total count of divisors
}

int main(){
    int n, b;
    int i=1;
    cin>>n; // Read the number of test cases
    while(i<=n){ // Loop through each test case
        cin>>b; // Read the number for which to find the divisors
        cout<<manners(b)<<endl; // Call the manners function and print the result
        m=2; // Reset the divisor to 2 for the next test case
        i++;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

**Part II: Summary**

This code is used to find the number of divisors of a given number. The `manners` function takes an integer `a` as input and returns the count of its divisors. It uses a recursive approach to find the divisors, starting from 2 and looping up to the square root of the number. If a divisor is found, the function recursively calls itself with the remainder of the number until it reaches 1. The total count of divisors is returned.

The `main` function reads the number of test cases, then loops through each test case, reading the number for which to find the divisors and calling the `manners` function to print the result. After each test case, the divisor is reset to 2 for the next test case.
