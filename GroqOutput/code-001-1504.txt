Here is the updated code with developer comments:

```
// Function to calculate the number of divisors of a given number using Horner's algorithm
int fenjie(int x, int b) {
    int i, z = 0, c;
    // Start from the given base 'b' and iterate up to the given number 'x'
    for (i = b; i <= x; i++) {
        // Check if 'x' is equal to 'i'
        if (x == i) {
            z = z + 1; // Increment the count of divisors
        } 
        else if (x % i == 0) { // Check if 'x' is divisible by 'i'
            c = x / i; // Calculate the quotient 'c'
            // Recursively call the function to find the number of divisors of 'c'
            z = z + fenjie(c, i);
        }
    }
    return (z);
}
```

And here is the Part II:

**Part II: Summary**

The code is a C program that calculates the number of divisors of a given integer using Horner's algorithm. The program prompts the user to enter a series of integers and displays the number of divisors for each integer. The main function reads the input integers, calls the fenjie function to calculate the number of divisors, and then prints the result.

The fenjie function takes two parameters: the integer to be processed and the base 'b'. It uses a for loop to iterate from the base 'b' up to the given integer 'x'. For each iteration, it checks if 'x' is equal to the current number 'i', and if so, increments the count of divisors. If 'x' is not equal to 'i', it checks if 'x' is divisible by 'i', and if so, calculates the quotient 'c' and recursively calls the fenjie function to find the number of divisors of 'c'.

The program is designed to work efficiently for large integers by leveraging the properties of Horner's algorithm, which reduces the number of unnecessary computations and optimizes the search for divisors.
