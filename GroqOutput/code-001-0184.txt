int f(int n, int m);				// Define a function f that takes two integers n and m
int main()
{
	int n, num, i;						// Declare variables n, num, and i
	cin >> n;						// Read an integer n from the input
	for(i=0;i<n;i++)				// Loop n times
	{
		cin >> num;					// Read an integer num from the input

	}
	return 0;
}
int f(int n, int m)
{
	int i, count=0;					// Initialize variables i and count
	if(n==1)
		return 1;					// Base case: if n is 1, return 1
	for(i=m;i<=n;i++)				// Loop from m to n
	{
		if(n%i==0)					// Check if n is divisible by i
			count += f(n/i,i);		// Recursively call f with n/i and i, and add the result to count
	}
	return count;					// Return the total count
}
```

**Part II**
This C++ code calculates the sum of all divisors of a given number, excluding the number itself, for a range of numbers. The program uses a recursive function `f` to calculate the sum of divisors for each number in the range.

The `main` function reads an integer `n` from the input and then loops `n` times. In each iteration, it reads an integer `num`, calls the `f` function with `num` and 2, and prints the result.

The `f` function takes two integers `n` and `m` as input. If `n` is 1, it returns 1 (base case). Otherwise, it loops from `m` to `n` and checks if `n` is divisible by `i`. If it is, it recursively calls `f` with `n/i` and `i`, adds the result to `count`, and returns the total count.

The code uses recursion to calculate the sum of divisors, which can be an efficient approach for small ranges of numbers. However, it may cause a stack overflow for large numbers due to the recursive function calls.
