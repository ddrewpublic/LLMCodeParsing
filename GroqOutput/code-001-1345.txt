Here is the code with developer comments:

**Part I**

```
int tru(int c)
{
  // Function to check if a number is prime
  int j, p = 0;
  if (c == 1 || c == 2)  // 1 and 2 are the only even prime numbers
    return 1;
  else 
    for (j = 2; j <= pow((double)c, 0.5); j++) {  // check up to square root of c
      if (c % j == 0) {
        p = 1;
        break;  // if c is divisible by j, it's not a prime number
      }
    }
  if (p == 1)  // if p is 1, it means c is not prime
    return 0;
  else 
    return 1;  // if p is 0, it means c is prime
}

int count(int a, int b)
{
  // Function to count the number of divisors of a number
  int i, k = 1;
  if (!tru(a))  // if a is not prime, it has more than 2 factors
    for (i = b; i <= pow((double)a, 0.5); i++) {
      if (a % i == 0) {
        k = k + count(a/i, i);  // recursively count the divisors of a/i
      }
    }
  return k;
}

int main()
{
  int n, x[999], q;
  // Read the number of test cases
  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (q = 0; q < n; q++) {
    // Read the number for each test case
    scanf("%d", &x[q]);
  }
  for (q = 0; q < n; q++) {
    // Print the number of divisors for each test case
    printf("%d\n", count(x[q], 2));
  }
  return 0;
}
```

**Part II**

The code is designed to count the number of divisors of a given number. The function `tru` checks if a number is prime, and the function `count` uses recursion to count the number of divisors of a number. The main function reads the number of test cases, reads the numbers for each test case, and then prints the number of divisors for each test case.

The `count` function is quite inefficient, as it uses recursion to count the divisors of a number. This can lead to a lot of repeated calculations, especially for large numbers. A more efficient approach would be to use iteration instead of recursion, or to use a more efficient algorithm to count the divisors of a number.
