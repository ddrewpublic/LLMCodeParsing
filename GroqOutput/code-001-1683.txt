```

void search(int a, int k) {
  // base cases: if a is 0 or 1, return immediately
  if (a == 0)
    return;
  if (a == 1)
    return;

  // iterate from 2 to a-1 to find prime factors
  for (int i = 2; i < a; i++) {
    // check if a is divisible by i and i is >= k
    if (a % i == 0 && a / i >= i && i >= k && a / i >= k) {
      // increment s and recursively call search with a/i and i
      s++;
      search(a / i, i);
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  int n, a;
  cin >> n; // read the number of test cases from input
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    s = 1; // reset s to 1 for each test case
    cin >> a; // read the number for which to find prime factors
    search(a, 1); // call search function with a and 1
    cout << s << endl; // print the number of prime factors

**Part II: Summary**

This program is designed to find the number of prime factors for a given number. The `search` function takes two integers, `a` and `k`, as inputs. It uses a recursive approach to find prime factors of `a` and stores the count in the global variable `s`. The function iterates from 2 to `a-1` to find prime factors and recursively calls itself with the quotient of `a` divided by the current candidate factor and the current candidate factor. The `main` function reads the number of test cases from input, iterates through each test case, and calls the `search` function to find the number of prime factors for each number. The program prints the number of prime factors for each test case.
