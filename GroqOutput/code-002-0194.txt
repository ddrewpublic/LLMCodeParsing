Here is the code with developer comments and a 200-word summary:

**Part I**

```c
struct book
{
    int num;
    char name[26];
    struct book *next;
};
```
Define a structure called `book` to hold the book's number, name, and a pointer to the next book in the list.

```c
struct book *creat(int m)
{
    // Declare pointers to a book structure and head
    struct book *head,*p1,*p2;
    p1=(struct book *)malloc(sizeof(struct book));
```
Create a function `creat` to create a linked list of `m` books. Declare three pointers to book structure and initialize the first pointer as a new book.

```c
    scanf("%d %s",&p1->num,p1->name);
    int i;
    for(i=1;i<m;i++)
    {
        if(i==1) head=p1;
```
Read the number and name of the first book and store it in the first pointer. Then, for each subsequent book, check if it's the first book in the list (if `i` is 1) and update the head pointer.

```c
        p2=p1;
        p1=(struct book *)malloc(sizeof(struct book));
        scanf("%d %s",&p1->num,p1->name);
    }
    p2->next=p1;p1->next=NULL;
    return(head);
}
```
Finish creating the linked list by setting the `next` pointer of the last book to `NULL` and returning the head of the list.

**Part II**

This code is designed to create a linked list of books and then analyze the most common letter in the book names. Here's a summary of the code's functions:

The `creat` function creates a linked list of `m` books, where each book has a number and a name. The main function reads this linked list and counts the frequency of each letter in the book names. It then finds the most common letter and prints its frequency and the corresponding book numbers.
