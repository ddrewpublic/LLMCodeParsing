**Part II**

This C++ code is designed to find the number of proper divisors for a given positive integer. The `slv` function is a recursive function that takes two integer arguments, `nm` and `pr`, where `nm` is the number to be processed and `pr` is the current prime number. The function counts the number of proper divisors of `nm` by recursively calling itself with smaller values of `nm` and `pr`. The `main` function reads `n` numbers from the input and calls the `slv` function for each number, printing the count of proper divisors. The code is efficient and can handle large inputs due to its recursive nature.
