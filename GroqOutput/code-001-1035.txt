```c++

{
    int i, sum = 0; // Initialize variables needed for the algorithm
    for(i = x; i <= sqrt(y); i++){ // Loop through all numbers less than or equal to the square root of y
        if(y % i == 0)  sum += f(i,y / i) + 1; // If y is divisible by i, recursively call f with y/i and add 1 to sum
    } // End of loop
    return sum; // Return the sum of all proper divisors of y, plus 1 (for y itself)
}

int main(){
    int n, x, i, b[100]; // Declare variables for the program
    cin>>n; // Read the value of n from input
    for(i=1;i<=n;i++){cin>>x;b[i]=x;} // Read n values from input and store them in array b
    for(i=1;i<=n;i++){cout<<f(2,b[i])+1<<endl;} // For each value in array b, call f with 2 and the value, and print the result plus 1

**Part II: Summary**

The provided code is a C++ program that calculates the sum of proper divisors of a given number. The `f` function takes two integers `x` and `y` as input and returns the sum of all proper divisors of `y` plus 1 (for `y` itself). The `main` function reads `n` values from input, stores them in an array `b`, and then for each value in the array, it calls the `f` function with 2 and the value, and prints the result plus 1.

The `f` function uses a recursive approach to find the sum of proper divisors. It starts by checking if `y` is divisible by `x`, and if so, it recursively calls itself with `y/i` and adds 1 to the sum. This process continues until `x` exceeds the square root of `y`, at which point the function returns the sum.

The program's output shows the sum of proper divisors of each input value, starting from 2.
