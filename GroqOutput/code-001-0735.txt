//Program to calculate the number of prime factors for each number in an array

        {
            sum=sum+1;             //Incrementing sum if a is divisible by k
            j=k;                   //Resetting j to k for the next iteration
            num(a/k);              //Recursively calling num(int a) for a/k
        }
    }
}

 Part II
This program calculates the number of prime factors for each number in an array. The user is prompted to input the number of elements (n) and then each element. For each element, the program calls the function num(int a) to calculate the prime factors. The sum of the prime factors is printed and reset for the next element. The num(int a) function recursively finds the prime factors by checking divisibility and updating the sum and j variables accordingly.
