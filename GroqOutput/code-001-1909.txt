```c

{
    // Declare variable t and a
    int t;
    int a;
    // Read the number of test cases from input
    cin>>t;

    {
        // Read the value of a for the current test case
        cin>>a;                      // Read the value of a
        // Call the function num() with the current value of a and 2, and print the result
        cout<<(num(a,2))<<endl;      // Print the result of the num() function
    }
    // Return 0 to indicate successful execution
    return 0;
}

int num(int a,int b)
{
    // Declare variable f and set it to 0
    int f=0;
    // If a is greater than or equal to b, then do the following
    if(a>=b)                    // Check if a is greater than or equal to b
    {
        // Loop from b to a
        for(int i=b;i<=a;i++)       // Loop from b to a
        {
            // If a is equal to the current number i, increment f by 1
            if(a==i) f++;
            // If a is divisible by the current number i, recursively call num() with a/i and i
            else if(a%i==0) f=f+num(a/i,i);     // Recursively call num() to count divisors
        }
    }
    // Return the total number of divisors

**Part II: Summary**

The given code is solving a problem of counting the number of divisors of a given number. The code is written in C++ and is divided into two parts: the `main()` function and the `num()` function.

The `main()` function reads the number of test cases from the input and then loops through each test case. For each test case, it reads the value of `a` and calls the `num()` function with the value of `a` and 2. The result of the `num()` function is then printed to the output.

The `num()` function counts the number of divisors of a given number `a`. It uses a recursive approach to achieve this. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, it loops from `b` to `a` and for each number `i` in this range, it increments the count of divisors `f` if `a` is equal to `i` or if `a` is divisible by `i`. The function then recursively calls itself with `a/i` and `i` until `a` is less than `b`. The total count of divisors is then returned.

Overall, the code provides a solution to the problem of counting the number of divisors of a given number using a recursive approach.
