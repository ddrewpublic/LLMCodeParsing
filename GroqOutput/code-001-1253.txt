**Part I**
```
int t;//t???
```
* Declare a global variable `t` that will be used to store the result of the function `f`.

```
void f(int n,int d)//n?????d???
{
```
* Declare a function `f` that takes two integers `n` and `d` as parameters. The purpose of this function is unknown at this point.

```
    int i;
```
* Declare a local variable `i` that will be used to iterate over a range of numbers.

```
    if(n==1)//
        t++;
```
* Check if `n` is equal to 1. If it is, increment the global variable `t`.

```
    else
    {
```
* If `n` is not equal to 1, execute the code inside the `else` block.

```
        for(i=d;i<=n;i++)
        {
```
* Iterate over a range of numbers from `d` to `n` (inclusive).

```
            if(n%i==0)
            {
```
* Check if `n` is divisible by `i`. If it is, execute the code inside the `if` block.

```
                f(n/i,i);
            }
        }
    }
```
* If `n` is divisible by `i`, recursively call the function `f` with `n` divided by `i` and `i` as parameters.

**Part II**

This code is a implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find all prime factors of a given number.

The main function takes an array of integers as input and for each number in the array, it calls the `f` function with the number and 2 as parameters. The `f` function recursively divides the number by its prime factors, and the global variable `t` keeps track of the number of prime factors. The result is stored in an array `result`, and finally, the results are printed to the console.

The `f` function is a recursive function that takes two parameters: `n` and `d`. It iterates over the range of numbers from `d` to `n` and checks if `n` is divisible by each number in the range. If it is, it recursively calls itself with `n` divided by `i` and `i` as parameters. If `n` is equal to 1, it increments the global variable `t`.
