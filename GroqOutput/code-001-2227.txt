**Part II**

This program calculates the sum of divisors for a given number. The function `p` checks if a number is prime, and the function `f` calculates the sum of divisors of a number. The `main` function reads the number of inputs and calculates the sum of divisors for each input, starting from 1.

The program uses a recursive approach to calculate the sum of divisors. For numbers that are not prime, the function `f` breaks them down into smaller numbers by dividing them by their divisors, and then calculates the sum of divisors for each smaller number. This process continues until the base case is reached, where the sum of divisors is simply 1.

The program can be improved by using a more efficient algorithm, such as the prime number theorem, to calculate the sum of divisors. Additionally, the program can be optimized by using a more efficient data structure, such as a heap or a balanced binary search tree, to store the divisors.
