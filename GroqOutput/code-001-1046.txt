Here is the code with developer comments added:

**Part I**
```
int f(int c,int t);
void main()
{
    // Declare integer variables n and c to store the number of inputs and each input respectively
    int n,c;
    // Read the number of inputs from the user
    scanf("%d",&n);
    // Loop through each input until n becomes 0
    for(;n>0;n--)
    {
        // Read the current input (c) from the user
        scanf("%d",&c);
        // Check if the current input is either 1 or 2
        if(c==1 || c==2)
            // If it is, print 1
            printf("1\n");
        else
            // If it is not, call the function f with c and 2 as arguments and print the result
            printf("%d\n",f(c,2));
    }
}
int f(int c,int t)
{
    // Initialize a counter variable count to 1
    int count=1,i;
    // Loop until i becomes c
    for(i=t;i<c;i++)
    {
        // If c is divisible by i, call the function f recursively with c/i and i as arguments and add the result to the count
        if(c%i==0)
            count+=f(c/i,i);
    }
    // If i becomes c, return the count
    if(i==c)	return count;
    // Otherwise, return 0
    else		return 0;
}
```

**Part II**

The given code is a solution to the Euler Project problem #25, which is related to the prime factorization of a number. The function `f(int c, int t)` calculates the sum of all proper divisors of a given number `c` considering the harmonic series `t` as the starting term. The function takes into account all divisors of `c` by recursively dividing `c` by its divisors until it reaches 1. The main function iterates through a list of input numbers, calling `f` for each number, and prints the results.

Note that the function has a high complexity due to its recursive nature and could cause a stack overflow for large input numbers.
