**Part I: Code with comments**

```
// Initialize two integer variables: temp and sum
int temp = 2, sum = 0;

// Define a recursive function dg that takes an integer x as input
void dg(int x) {
  // Initialize a for loop from temp to x
  for (int i = temp; i <= x; i++) {
    // Check if x is divisible by i
    if (x % i == 0) {
      // Update temp to the current divisor
      temp = i;
      // Check if the divisor is 1 (i.e., x is a prime number)
      if (x / i == 1) {
        // Increment the sum counter
        sum++;
        // Reset temp to 2 for the next iteration
        temp = 2;
      } else {
        // Recursively call dg with the quotient of x and i
        dg(x / i);
      }
    }
  }
}

// Define the main function
int main() {
  // Read an integer n from the input
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  // Read x numbers from the input
  int x;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> x;
    // Call dg with the current number x
    dg(x);
    // Print the sum
    cout << sum << endl;
    // Reset sum to 0 for the next iteration
    sum = 0;
  }
  // Return 0 to indicate successful execution
  return 0;
}

**Part II: Summary**

The code is designed to count the number of prime numbers within a given input number range. The `dg` function recursively checks if a number is prime by dividing it by all numbers from 2 to the input number. If the number is divisible by any of these, it is not prime and the function will continue to divide the number until it becomes 1, which indicates that the number is prime. The `main` function reads a range of numbers from the input and for each number, it calls the `dg` function to count the prime numbers in that range, printing the result. The `sum` variable keeps track of the prime numbers for each range, and is reset to 0 at the beginning of each new range.
