**Part II: Summary**

This code is a C++ program that checks if a given number is a prime number or not. Prime numbers are numbers that are divisible only by 1 and themselves.

The program consists of two functions: `ifsushu()` and `zhaoyinshu()`. The `ifsushu()` function takes an integer as input and returns 1 if the number is prime, and 0 otherwise. The `zhaoyinshu()` function calculates the sum of divisors of a number by recursively dividing the number by its divisors and adding the divisors to the sum.

In the `main()` function, the program takes an integer `time` as input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `number` and checks if it is a prime number using the `ifsushu()` function. If the number is prime, it prints "1". If the number is not prime, it calculates the sum of its divisors using the `zhaoyinshu()` function and adds 1 to the sum before printing it.

The program uses the `sum` variable to store the sum of divisors for each test case, and resets it to 0 after each test case.
