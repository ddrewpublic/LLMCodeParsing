**Part II: Summary**

This code calculates the sum of divisors for a given set of numbers. The `find` function is a recursive function that takes a number `m` and a starting divisor `n` as input. It calculates the sum of divisors by recursively calling itself with the quotient and remainder of `m` and the current divisor, until `m` becomes 1. The result is stored in the variable `tot`.

The `main` function reads the number of test cases from the input and loops through each test case. For each test case, it resets the total sum and calls the `find` function with the input number and 2 as the starting divisor. The total sum is then printed to the output. The code has a limitation in that it does not handle the case where the input number is 0 or a negative number, and it may not be efficient for large input numbers due to the recursive function calls.
