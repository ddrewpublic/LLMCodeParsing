**Part I**

```
int cishu[26];
```
Declares an array `cishu` of size 26 to store the frequency of letters in the name strings. 

```
struct shu
{
	int num;
	char name[26];
	struct shu *next;
};
```
Declares a struct `shu` which represents a linked list node. The node contains an integer `num`, a character array `name` of size 26, and a pointer to the next node in the list.

```
struct shu *app(int n)
{
    int i,len,j;
    struct shu *newnode ,*p, *head;
```
Declares variables `i`, `len`, and `j` to be used in the function `app`. This function creates a linked list of `n` nodes and returns the head of the list. It also declares a pointer `newnode` to dynamically allocate memory for a new node, and pointers `p` and `head` to traverse the list.

```
    for(i=1;i<=n;i++)
    {
        newnode=(struct shu *)malloc(sizeof(struct shu));
```
Loops `n` times to create a linked list of `n` nodes. In each iteration, it dynamically allocates memory for a new node using `malloc` and assigns it to `newnode`.
