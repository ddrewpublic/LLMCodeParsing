**Part II: Summary**

This C program reads in a list of books and their maintainers, where each maintainer is represented by a 26-character string (a-z, A-Z). The program then finds the maintainer who has written the most books and prints out the name of that maintainer and the number of books they have written. Finally, it prints out the numbers of all the books written by that maintainer. The program uses a 26-element array `c` to count the frequency of each maintainer, and a 26-element array `b` to represent the alphabet.
