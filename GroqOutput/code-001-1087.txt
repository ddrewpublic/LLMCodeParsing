// Main function, reads the number of inputs, calls the search function for each input and prints the sum of divisors.

**Part II**

This code is designed to find the sum of divisors of a number. It works by recursively dividing the number by its divisors, starting from 2, until it reaches 1. The sum of these divisors is then printed out. The code takes multiple inputs, one at a time, and processes each one individually. The main output is the sum of divisors for each input.
