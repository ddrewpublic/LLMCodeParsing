**Part II: Description and Summary**

Summary:
The program is a recursive function that calculates the number of times a number can be divided into equal parts with a specific quotient, and prints the number of times it can be divided. The function takes two parameters: the initial number `sum` and the quotient `q`. The program reads the number of test cases `n` and then for each test case, it reads the number `sum` and calculates the result by calling the `out` function recursively.

**Part I: Code with Comments**

```cpp
// Start of the program
void out(int, int); // Function prototype for the out function

int t = 1; // Initialize variable t to 1

int main() {
    int n = 0; // Initialize variable n to 0
    int i = 0; // Initialize variable i to 0
    double sum = 0; // Initialize variable sum to 0
    
    // Read the number of test cases
    cin >> n;
    
    // Loop through each test case
    for (i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        // Read the number for the current test case
        cin >> sum;
        
        // Call the out function with the current sum and quotient 2
        out(sum, 2.0);
        
        // Print the number of times it can be divided
        cout << t << endl;
        
        // Reset the variable t to 1 for the next test case
        t = 1;
    }
    
    // Read the last number
    cin >> i;
    
    // Return 0 to indicate successful execution
    return 0;
}

// Definition of the out function
void out(int sum, int q) {
    int num = 0; // Initialize variable num to 0
    double m = sum; // Initialize variable m to sum
    
    // Calculate the square root of sum
    num = sqrt(m);
    
    // If the sum can be divided by the quotient and the quotient is less than or equal to the square root
    if (sum % q == 0 && q <= num) {
        // Increment the variable t
        t++;
        
        // Call the out function recursively with the sum divided by the quotient and the quotient
        out(sum / q, q);
        
        // Call the out function recursively with the sum and the next quotient
        out(sum, q + 1);
    }
    
    // If the sum cannot be divided by the quotient and the quotient is less than or equal to the square root
    if (sum % q != 0 && q <= num) {
        // Call the out function recursively with the sum and the next quotient
        out(sum, q + 1);
    }
}
```
