// Function to calculate the number of prime factors of a given number
int ans(int a, int i) {
    // Initialize a variable to store the sum of prime factors
    int sum = 0;

        cin >> a;
        // Print the sum of prime factors plus 1 (because 1 is also a prime factor)
        cout << ans(a, 2) + 1 << endl;

**Part II: Summary (200 words)**

This code is written in C++ and calculates the number of prime factors of a given number. The function `ans` takes two parameters, `a` and `i`, where `a` is the number to be factored and `i` is the starting point for the factorization. The function returns the sum of the prime factors.

The `main` function tests the `ans` function by reading the number of test cases from the input and for each test case, it reads a number `a` and prints the sum of its prime factors plus 1. The reason for adding 1 is that 1 is also considered a prime factor.

The code uses a recursive approach to factor the number. It starts by checking if `a` is divisible by `i`, and if so, it increments the sum and recursively calls `ans` with `a` divided by `i`. If `a` is not divisible by `i`, it continues with the next number `j`. The code also uses a loop to iterate through all numbers from `i` to the square root of `a`.

Overall, this code is efficient in terms of time complexity (O(sqrt(n))) and can be used to solve problems related to prime factors and factorization.
