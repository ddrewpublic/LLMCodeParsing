**Part II: Summary**

This program reads in a sequence of books, where each book has a title and a number of pages. It then analyzes the titles to find the most frequent letter and prints out the letter, its occurrences, and the titles of the books where it appears. The program uses dynamic memory allocation to store the books and performs a series of loops to count the occurrences of each letter and sort the letters by their occurrences.
