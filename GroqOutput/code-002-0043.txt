**Part II: Summary**

This code reads a series of book titles from the standard input, along with their corresponding numbers. It then calculates the frequency of each letter of the alphabet in the book titles and determines which letter appears most frequently. The program then prints the most frequently occurring letter, as well as its frequency, and finally prints the numbers of the books that contain this letter. The code uses two arrays, 'a' and 'c', to store the alphabet and the letter frequencies, respectively. The 'book' structure is used to represent each book, with 'num' storing the book's number and 'w' storing the book's title. The program iterates over each book and calculates the frequency of each letter in the title, and then finds the most frequently occurring letter by iterating over the frequencies and keeping track of the highest count.
