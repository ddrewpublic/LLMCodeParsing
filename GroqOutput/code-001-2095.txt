Here is the code with developer comments and a summary:

**Part I**
```c
int panduansushu(int t) {
    // check if t is a prime number
    int i;
    for(i = 2; i < t; i++) {
        // if t is divisible by any number between 2 and t-1, it's not prime
        if(t % i == 0) {break;}
    }
    // if the loop reaches t/2 and no divisor is found, t is prime
    if(i > t / 2) return 1;
    else return 0;
}

int sum = 0;
void fun(int n, int i) {
    // calculate the sum of divisors of n
    if(n == 1) sum++;
    for(; i <= n; i++) {
        // if n is divisible by i, recursively call fun with n/i and i
        if(n % i == 0) fun(n / i, i);
    }
}

void main() {
    int a[100], i, res, j, n;
    // read the number of elements and the elements themselves
    scanf("%d", &n);
    for(j = 0; j < n; j++) scanf("%d", &a[j]);
    // for each element, check if it's prime
    for(j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        if(panduansushu(a[j]) == 1) {
            // if it's prime, print 1
            printf("1\n");
        } else {
            // if it's not prime, calculate the sum of its divisors
            for(i = 2, res = 1; i < a[j] / 2; i++) {
                if(a[j] % i == 0) {
                    // reset sum to 0 and calculate the sum of divisors
                    sum = 0; fun(a[j] / i, i); res += sum;
                }
            }
            // print the sum of divisors
            printf("%d\n", res);
        }
    }
}
```

**Part II**
Summary:
This C program is designed to check prime numbers and calculate the sum of divisors for non-prime numbers. The `panduansushu` function checks if a given number is prime by iterating from 2 to the number and checking for divisors. If no divisors are found, the number is prime. The `fun` function recursively calculates the sum of divisors for a given number by dividing the number by its divisors and recursively calling itself. In the `main` function, the program reads an array of numbers and for each number, it checks if it's prime using the `panduansushu` function. If it's not prime, it calculates the sum of its divisors using the `fun` function and prints the result.
