**Part I**

```c
int fib(int a,int e);
int main(){
    int n,b,i;
    // Read the number of n from the console
    scanf("%d",&n);
    // Loop until n times to read b and print the result of fib(b,2) 
    for(i=1;i<=n;i++){
        // Read b from the console
        scanf("%d",&b);
        // Print the result of fib(b,2)
        printf("%d\n",fib(b,2));
    }
    // Read another number from the console
    scanf("%d",&n);
    // Exit the program
    return 0;
}
int fib(int a,int e){
    int j,c,d;
    // Initialize c to 1
    c=1;
    // If a is less than or equal to e, return 1
    if(a<=e) return 1;
    // Loop until j is less than or equal to the square root of a
    for(j=e;j<=sqrt(a);j++){
        // If a is divisible by j
        if(a%j==0){
            // Calculate d as the quotient of a and j
            d=a/j;
            // Add the result of fib(d,j) to c
            c=c+fib(d,j);
        }
    }
    // Return c
    return c;

**Part II**

The provided code calculates the number of divisors of a given number in a recursive manner. The main function reads a number of inputs from the console and for each input, it calculates the number of divisors and prints the result. The fib function calculates the number of divisors by recursively adding the number of divisors of the quotients of the number until it reaches 1. The program also uses the sqrt function to optimize the calculation by only considering the divisors up to the square root of the number. This is because if a is not a perfect square, it has either no divisors or one divisor that is greater than its square root.
