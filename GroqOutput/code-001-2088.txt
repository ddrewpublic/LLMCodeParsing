**Part II: Summary**

This code is a solution to a programming problem that requires calculating the sum of proper divisors for a given number. The `f` function takes two integers, `num` and `i`, as arguments and returns the sum of proper divisors of `num`. It uses a recursive approach to calculate the sum, calling itself with `num/j` and `j` as arguments if `num/j` is greater than `j`. The `main` function reads the number of test cases and loops through each test case, scanning a number and calling the `f` function with `num` and `j` as arguments, then printing the sum plus 1.
