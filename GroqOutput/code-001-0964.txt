Here is the code with developer comments and a summary:

**Part I: Code with comments**

```
int countt; // global variable to count the number of factors

void f(int p, int q) {
    // recursive function to find factors of a number
    for (int m = p; m <= sqrt(q); m++) {
        // iterate from p to sqrt(q)
        if (q % m == 0) {
            // if q is divisible by m, increment the count and recurse
            countt++;
            f(m, q / m);
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    int n;
    // read the number of test cases
    cin >> n;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        // read the input number
        int num;
        cin >> num;
        countt = 0; // reset the count for each test case
        for (int k = 2; k <= sqrt(num); k++) {
            // iterate from 2 to sqrt(num)
            if (num % k == 0) {
                // if num is divisible by k, increment the count and recurse
                countt++;
                f(k, num / k);
            }
        }
        // print the count (plus 1, since we start counting from 1)
        cout << countt + 1 << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

**Part II: Summary**

This code calculates the number of factors for a given set of numbers. The recursive function `f` takes two parameters, `p` and `q`, where `p` is the starting point to search for factors and `q` is the number to find factors for. The function increments a global variable `countt` for each factor found and recursively calls itself with the discovered factors. In the `main` function, the code reads the number of test cases `n`, then iterates over each test case, reading an input number and calculating its factors using the `f` function. The count of factors is printed for each test case.
