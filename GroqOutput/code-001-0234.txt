**Part II: Summary**

The code is designed to solve a problem where it takes as input a list of numbers and for each number, it finds the ways to break it down into its multiples. The number of ways is calculated by recursively calling a function that checks for each divisor whether the number can be divided by it and then recursively calls itself with the quotient and the current divisor until it reaches 1.
