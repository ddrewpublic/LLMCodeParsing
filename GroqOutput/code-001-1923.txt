Here is the code with developer comments added:

**Part I**

```c
int digui(int m,int n,int sum) {
    // Initial declaration of a variable 'i'
    int i;
    // Increment the sum by 1
    sum++;
    // Check if the square root of 'm' is less than 'n'
    if(sqrt(m)<n) {
        // If true, return 'sum'
        return sum;
    } else {
        // Otherwise, iterate from 'n' to the square root of 'm'
        for(i=n;i<=sqrt(m);i++) {
            // Check if 'm' is divisible by 'i'
            if(m%i==0) {
                // If true, recursively call 'digui' with 'm/i', 'i', and 'sum'
                sum=digui(m/i,i,sum);
            }
        }
        // Return the updated 'sum'
        return sum;
    }
}

void main() {
    // Declare 'n' and 'a' variables
    int n,a;
    // Scan the value of 'n'
    scanf("%d",&n);
    // Loop until 'n' becomes 0
    while(n--) {
        // Scan the value of 'a'
        scanf("%d",&a);
        // Print the result of the 'digui' function with 'a', 2, and 0, and a newline character
        printf("%d\n",digui(a,2,0));
    }
}
```

**Part II**

This code is written to find the sum of the number of divisors of all numbers from 1 to n, where n is the input value. The function `digui` recursively calculates the sum of the number of divisors of a given number by dividing the number by all integers from 'n' to its square root. The `main` function takes the input value 'n', and then iteratively calculates the sum of the number of divisors of all numbers from 1 to 'n', and prints the result.

The key part of this code is the use of recursion in the `digui` function, where each call to the function divides the input number by a divisor, and then recursively calls itself with the quotient and the divisor until the quotient becomes 1. The sum of the divisors is incremented by 1 for each successful division, and the function returns the final sum. The `main` function then calls the `digui` function for each input number, and prints the result.
