**Part I**

```
// This code calculates the number of divisors of a given integer.
// The function f(a, m) calculates the number of divisors of the number a.
// This value includes 1 and a itself, so a is considered to be a divisors of itself.
int f(int a, int m)                 // the function f calculates the number of divisors of a.
{ 
    if(a<m) 
    // If the given number a is less than m, there are no divisors of a less than m
    // So the function returns 0.
    return 0; 
    int kind=1; 
    // Initialize the variable kind to 1.
    for(int i=m;i<a;i++)              // Loop through all numbers from m to a-1
    { 
        if(a%i==0)                         // If a is divisible by i
        kind=kind+f(a/i,i); 
        // The number of divisors of a is the sum of the number of divisors of a/i and i.
    } 
    return kind; 
} 

// This is the main function.
int main()
{
    int n,a[100];              // Declare an array to store n integers.
    cin>>n;                     // Read the number of integers.
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++)     // Loop through each integer
        cin>>a[i];              // Read the integer.
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        cout<<f(a[i],2)<<endl;    // Calculate and print the number of divisors of each integer.
    return 0;
}
```

**Part II**

This code calculates the number of divisors of each of the integers read from the input. It defines a function `f(a, m)` that calculates the number of divisors of the integer `a` by recursively finding the number of divisors of `a` divided by `m` and the number of divisors of `m`. The main function reads `n` integers from the input and then prints the number of divisors of each integer using the function `f(a, 2)`. This means that the divisors of each integer are calculated starting from 2, and this is repeated for all numbers from 2 to the given integer.
