Here is the code with developer comments:

**Part I**

```
int num = 0; // initialize variable num to 0
int judge1(int n)
{
    int i;
    if(n==2||n==3||n==5) // if n is 2, 3, or 5, return 1
    {
        return 1;
    }
    if(n==4) // if n is 4, return 0
    {
        return 0;
    }
    for(i=2;i*i<n;i++) // iterate from 2 to sqrt(n) - 1
    {
        if(n%i==0) // if n is divisible by i, return 0 and break
        {
            return 0;
            break;
        }
    }
    if(i*i>n) // if i is greater than sqrt(n), return 1
    {
        return 1;
    }
}
```

**Part II**

This code is a prime factorization program that takes an integer as input and outputs the number of distinct prime factors it has. The `judge1` function is used to check if a number is prime, and the `divide` function recursively finds the prime factors of a given number.

Here's a summary of the code:

This program uses a recursive function `divide` to find the prime factors of a given number. The function takes two integer parameters, `n` and `d`, where `n` is the number to be divided and `d` is the current divisor. The function iterates from `d` to the square root of `n`, checking if `n` is divisible by each divisor. If it is, the function increments a counter `num` and recursively calls itself with the quotient `n/i` and the updated divisor `d`. The function returns 0 if a divisor is found, indicating that the number is not prime. The `judge1` function is used to check if a number is prime, and the main function uses this function to determine the number of distinct prime factors of each input number.
