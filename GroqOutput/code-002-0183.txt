**Part I: Code**

```
void main()

    // Declare a struct called book with two members: num (an integer) and name (a character array of size 26)
    struct book
    {
        int num;
        char name[26];
    };
    // Declare four integer variables: m, i, j, and max
    int m,i,j,max;

    int sum[26]={0};
    // Read an integer from the standard input and store it in m
    scanf("%d",&m);
    // Declare an array of m struct book objects called b
    struct book b[m];
    // For each book in the array, read an integer and a string from the standard input
    // and store them in the corresponding book object
    for(i=0;i<m;i++)

**Part II: Summary**

This program is designed to find the most frequent character in the titles of multiple books and print the numbers of all books that have this character in their title. The program uses a struct to represent a book with an integer and a string for the title. It then reads the titles of the books from the standard input and counts the frequency of each character in each title. It finds the index of the most frequent character and prints its frequency. Finally, it prints the numbers of all books that have this character in their title. The program assumes that the input is well-formed and does not contain any errors.
