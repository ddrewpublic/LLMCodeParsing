**Part I: Code with Comments**

```c

	// Define a book structure with an integer for the number,
	// a character pointer for the name, and a pointer to the next book
	int num;
	char *name;
	struct book *next;

	// Declare variables to store the number of books, and pointers for the head and current books
	int n, i;
	scanf("%d", &n); // Read the number of books from the console
	struct book *p1, *p2, *head;
	p1 = len; // Initialize p1 to some value (not sure why len is used here)
	head = p1; // Set the head of the list to p1
	
	// Loop through each book
	for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		p1->name = (char *)malloc(26 * 1); // Allocate memory for the book's name
		scanf("%d %s", &p1->num, p1->name); // Read the book's number and name from the console

	p1 = p2 = head;
	
	// Loop through each book and print the numbers of books that contain the letter with the highest frequency
	for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		j = 0;
		while (*(p1->name + j) != '\0') {
			if (*(p1->name + j) == maxl) {
				printf("%d\n", p1->num);
				break;

			j += 1;
		}
		p1 = p1->next;
	}
}
```

**Part II: Summary**

The code defines a linked list of books, where each book has a number and a name. The program reads the number of books from the console, creates the books with their numbers and names, and then counts the frequency of each letter in the names. It finds the letter with the highest frequency and prints the letter and its frequency. Finally, it loops through the books again and prints the numbers of books that contain the letter with the highest frequency.
