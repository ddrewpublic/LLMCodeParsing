**Part II**

Summary:

The code is a recursive implementation in C to find the number of prime divisors of a given number. The function `F()` takes two parameters, `min` and `a`, where `min` is the minimum number and `a` is the number for which we need to find the number of prime divisors. The function checks if `a` is divisible by any number `i` from `min` to `a`, and if so, recursively calls itself with `i` and `a/i` as parameters. The total sum of these recursive calls is the number of prime divisors of `a`. The `main()` function reads input numbers from the user and calls the `F()` function to print the number of prime divisors for each number.
