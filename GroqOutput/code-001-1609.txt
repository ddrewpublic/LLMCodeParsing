```c
int ys(int x, int min) {
    // Initialize the result variable to 1
    int r = 1;
    
    // If the input number x is less than the minimum number min, return 0
    if (x < min) {
        return 0;
    }
    
    // Iterate from min to x
    for (int i = min; i < x; i++) {
        // Check if x is divisible by i
        if (x % i == 0) {
            // Recursively call the function with x divided by i as the new x and i as the new minimum
            r += ys(x / i, i);
        }
    }
    
    // Return the result
    return r;
}

int main() {
    // Declare integer variables n and a[1000]
    int n, a[1000];
    
    // Read the value of n from standard input
    scanf("%d", &n);
    
    // Read n integers and store them in the array a
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        scanf("%d", &a[i]);
    }
    
    // Iterate over the array a
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        // Print the result of calling the function ys with the current element of a as the input and 2 as the minimum
        printf("%d\n", ys(a[i], 2));
    }
    
    // Return 0 to indicate successful execution
    return 0;
}
```

**Part II: Summary**

The provided C code is a recursive function that calculates the number of divisors for a given integer, along with a main function that reads input numbers, calls the function for each number, and prints the results. The `ys` function takes two parameters: `x` (the input number) and `min` (the minimum number to consider for divisors).

The function iterates from `min` to `x` and checks if `x` is divisible by each number in the range. If it is, the function recursively calls itself with `x` divided by the current number and the current number as the new `min`. The result is the sum of the results of all recursive calls plus 1 (for the number itself).

In the main function, the code reads an integer `n` and then `n` numbers. For each number, it calls the `ys` function with the number and `2` as the minimum, and prints the result. The program then terminates with a return value of 0.
