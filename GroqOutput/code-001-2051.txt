Here is the code with developer comments:

**Part I: Code**

```c
int count;
```
Declaring a global integer variable `count`.

```c
void f(int a ,int b)
{
	// Use a local integer variable j
    int j;
    if(a==1)
	{
        // If a is 1, increment the global count variable
		count+=1;
    }
    else
    {
        // If a is not 1, use a loop to iterate from b to a
        for(j=b;j<=a;j++)
        {
            // Check if a is divisible by j
            if(a%j==0)
            {
                // If a is divisible by j, recursively call the function
                f(a/j,j);
            }
        }
    }
}
```
Defining the `f` function takes a positive integer `a` and a positive integer `b` as input and performs a recursive algorithm to count the number of divisors of `a`.

```c
int main()
{
    // Declare an integer variable n
    int n;
    // Declare an integer variable i
    int i;
    // Declare an integer variable number
    int number;
    // Use scanf to read an integer from the standard input
    scanf("%d",&n);
    for(i=0;i<n;i++)
    {
        // Initialize the global count variable to 0
        count=0;
        // Use scanf to read an integer from the standard input
        scanf("%d",&number);
        // Call the f function with the read number and 2 as input
        f(number,2);
        // Use printf to print the count to the standard output
        printf("%d\n",count);
    }
    return 0;
}
```
Defining the `main` function reads an integer `n` from the standard input, iterates `n` times, reads an integer `number` each time, calls the `f` function with `number` and 2 as input, and prints the count to the standard output.

**Part II: Summary**

This code is a solution to a problem that counts the number of divisors of a given positive integer `number`. The code uses a recursive algorithm implemented in the `f` function, which takes an integer `a` and a positive integer `b` as input. The algorithm checks if `a` is divisible by `b` and if so, recursively calls itself with `a` divided by `b` and `b` as input. The `main` function reads an integer `n` from the standard input, iterates `n` times, reads an integer `number` each time, calls the `f` function with `number` and 2 as input, and prints the count to the standard output.
