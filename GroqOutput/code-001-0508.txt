```
int fenjie(int x, int y) { // Function to find the number of unique prime factors of a number
    int i, s = 0; // Initialize counter for unique prime factors

    if (x == y) // Base case: if x is equal to y, return 1
        return 1;
    for (i = y; i <= x; i++) { // Iterate from y to x
        if (x % i == 0) { // Check if x is divisible by i
            s += fenjie(x / i, i); // Recursively call the function with x divided by i and i
        }
    }
    if (i == x) // If i equals x, it means x is a prime number, increment the counter
        s++;
    return s;

int main() {
    int n, i; // Initialize variables for the number of inputs and input values

    cin >> n; // Read the number of inputs
    for (; n > 0; n--) { // Loop until all inputs have been processed
        cin >> i; // Read the current input value
        cout << fenjie(i, 2) << endl; // Call the function to find the unique prime factors and print the result
    }

**Part II: Summary**

This C++ program is designed to find the number of unique prime factors of a given integer. The `fenjie` function takes two integer parameters, `x` and `y`, and returns the number of unique prime factors of `x`. The function uses a recursive approach to find the prime factors, dividing `x` by each number from `y` to `x` until it finds a prime number. The `main` function reads a series of integer inputs from the user and calls the `fenjie` function for each input, printing the result to the console. The program is efficient in its use of recursion, but may cause a stack overflow for very large input values.
