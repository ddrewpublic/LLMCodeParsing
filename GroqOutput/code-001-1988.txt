Here is the code with developer comments and a summary:

**Part I**
```
int dfs(int k, int b) {
  // Initialize the return value to 0 if k is not 1
  int ret=(k==1),i;
  // Loop through all numbers from b to k
  for (i=b;i<=k;i++) {
    // Check if k is divisible by i
    if (k%i==0) {
      // If k is divisible by i, recursively call dfs with k/i and i
      ret+=dfs(k/i,i);
    }
  }
  // Return the accumulated result
  return ret;
}
```

**Part II**

The code provided is a recursive function to calculate the sum of all proper divisors of a given number `k`. Here is a summary of the code:

The function `dfs` takes two integer parameters `k` and `b`. It recursively calculates the sum of all proper divisors of `k` starting from `b`. The function initializes a variable `ret` to 0 if `k` is 1, and then loops through all numbers from `b` to `k`. For each number `i` in this range, it checks if `k` is divisible by `i`. If it is, it recursively calls `dfs` with `k/i` and `i`, and adds the result to `ret`. Finally, it returns `ret`.

The `main` function reads an integer `n` from the input, and then for each of the `n` inputs, it reads an integer `k`, calls `dfs` with `k` and 2, and prints the result to the output.
