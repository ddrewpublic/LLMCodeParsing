**Part II**

Summary:
This program is designed to find the number of divisors of a given integer m. The program uses a recursive function called devide to find the divisors. The main function takes an integer n as input and then reads m and calls the devide function for each m. The devide function takes two integer parameters a and b. It checks from a to the square root of b for divisors of b, incrementing the variable s for each divisor found. It then recursively calls itself with the divisor and the quotient of b and the divisor, until it reaches the base condition of the recursion (i.e., a = 1).
