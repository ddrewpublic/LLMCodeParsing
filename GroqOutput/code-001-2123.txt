**Part I: Code with Comments**

```c
int f(int a, int s) {
    // Initialize variable y to 0
    int y = 0;
    // Loop until s is less than or equal to a
    for (; s <= a; s++) {
        // If s is equal to a, increment y by 1
        if (s == a) {
            y += 1;
        } 
        // If s is greater than 1 and a is divisible by s, recursively call function f
        else if (s > 1 && a % s == 0) {
            y += f(a / s, s);
        }
    }
    // Return the value of y
    return y;    
}

main () {
    // Declare integer variables n, i, and a
    int n, i, a;
    // Read input value n
    scanf ("%d", &n);
    // Loop n times
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        // Read input value a
        scanf ("%d", &a);
        // Print the result of calling function f with a and 1
        printf ("%d\n", f(a, 1));
    }
}
```

**Part II: Summary**

This code implements a function `f(a, s)` that calculates the sum of all divisors of a number `a` excluding `a` itself, starting from `s`. The function uses a recursive approach, where it checks if the current divisor `s` is equal to `a`, in which case it increments the sum by 1, or if `s` is greater than 1 and `a` is divisible by `s`, in which case it recursively calls the function with `a` divided by `s` and `s` as the new arguments. The function returns the final sum.

In the `main()` function, the code reads an integer value `n` and then iterates `n` times, reading an integer value `a` each time and printing the result of calling the `f(a, 1)` function, which calculates the sum of all divisors of `a` excluding `a` itself starting from 1. The output is the sum of the divisors of each input number.
