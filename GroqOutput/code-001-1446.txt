**Part I: Code with Comments**

```
int sum = 0; // Initialize sum variable to 0
int main()
{
    void yinshu(int, int); // Declare function prototype for yinshu()
    int i, n, a; // Declare variables for loop
    cin >> n; // Read input for number of iterations
    for (i = 1; i <= n; i++)
    {
        sum = 0; // Reset sum for each iteration
        cin >> a; // Read input for current number
        yinshu(a, 2); // Call yinshu function to calculate sum
        cout << sum << endl; // Print calculated sum
    }
    return 0; // Return 0 to indicate successful execution
}
void yinshu(int a, int x)
{
    if (a != 1) // Check if number is not 1
    {
        for (int i = x; i <= a; i++) // Loop from x to a
        {
            if (a % i == 0) // Check if a is divisible by i
                yinshu(a / i, i); // Recursively call yinshu with a/i and i
        }
    }
    if (a == 1) // Check if number is 1
        sum++; // Increment sum if number is 1
}
```

**Part II: Summary**

This code is designed to calculate the sum of proper divisors for each number in a given input sequence. The program uses a recursive function `yinshu()` to perform this calculation. The function takes two parameters: `a`, the number to calculate divisors for, and `x`, the starting point for the divisor search.

In the main function, the program reads input for the number of iterations and the numbers to calculate divisors for. For each number, it calls the `yinshu()` function, which recursively calculates the divisors and updates the `sum` variable. The final sum is then printed to the console.

The code uses a bottom-up approach to calculate divisors, starting from the smallest divisor and incrementing until the largest divisor is found. This approach is more efficient than a top-down approach, as it avoids recalculating divisors for larger numbers. Overall, this code is designed to provide an accurate and efficient calculation of proper divisors for a given sequence of numbers.
