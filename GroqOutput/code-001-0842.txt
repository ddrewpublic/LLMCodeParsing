**Part II**

This code is a C++ program that calculates the sum of the maximum prime factors of a given set of numbers. The program first declares a function `yinshu` that takes an integer as an argument and calculates the sum of the maximum prime factors of that number.

In the `main` function, the program reads an integer `n` as input, then reads `n` more integers `m` as input. For each `m`, it calls the `yinshu` function to calculate the sum of the maximum prime factors, then prints the result.

The `yinshu` function uses a recursive approach to find the maximum prime factors of the input number. It does this by dividing the number by the current prime factor, updating the current prime factor, and repeating the process until the number is reduced to 1. The sum of the maximum prime factors is calculated by incrementing the `sum` variable whenever a new prime factor is found.
