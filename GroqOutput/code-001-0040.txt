Here is the code with developer comments and a 200-word summary:

**Part I: Code**

```c
int main()
{
    // Declare the function f and variables n, m, i, and z
    int f(int x, int y);
    int n, m, i, z;

    // Read an integer n from the user
    scanf("%d", &n);

    // Iterate n times
    for(i=0; i<n; i++)
    {
        // Read an integer m from the user
        scanf("%d", &m);

        // Call the function f with arguments 1 and m, and print the result
        z = f(1, m);
        printf("%d\n", z);
    }

    // Return 0 to indicate successful execution
    return 0;
}

int f(int x, int y)
{
    // Declare variables z, t, and p
    int z, t = 1, l = 0, p;

    // Calculate p as the square root of y
    p = (int) pow(y, 0.5);

    // If x is 1, set it to 2
    if(x == 1) x = 2;

    // Iterate from x to p
    for(z = x; z <= p; z++)
    {
        // If y is divisible by z and z is not equal to y
        if(y % z == 0 && z != y)
        {
            // Recursively call f with z and y divided by z
            t += f(z, y / z);
        }
    }

    // Return the result
    return t;
}
```

**Part II: Summary**

The code presented above is a program that calculates the sum of all distinct proper divisors of a given number. It does this by using a recursive function called f that takes two integer arguments, x and y. The function iterates from x to the square root of y, and for each number z in this range, it checks if y is divisible by z and if z is not equal to y. If these conditions are met, the function recursively calls itself with z and y divided by z. The function returns the sum of all these divisors. The main function reads an integer n and then iterates n times, reading an integer m and calling the function f with arguments 1 and m. The result is then printed to the console.
