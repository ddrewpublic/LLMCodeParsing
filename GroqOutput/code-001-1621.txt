Here is the code with comments added:

**Part I**

```c
int f(int a, int min) {
    // Initialize the result variable to 1, and a counter variable i
    int result = 1, i;

    // If a is less than min, return 0 immediately
    if (a < min) {
        return 0;
    } else {
        // Start a loop from min to a
        for (i = min; i <= a; i++) {
            // Check if a is divisible by i
            if (a % i == 0) {
                // If a is divisible by i, recursively call f with a/i and i
                result += f(a / i, i);
            }
        }
        // Return the final result
        return result;
    }
}
```

**Part II**

Summary:

The code provided is a C program that calculates the sum of all divisors of a given number. The function `f(a, min)` recursively finds all divisors of `a` greater than or equal to `min`, and the main function uses a loop to calculate and print the sum of divisors for multiple input numbers. The program uses the Euler's Totient Function to calculate the sum of divisors.

The code consists of two main parts: the `f` function and the `main` function. The `f` function takes two integer arguments `a` and `min`, and returns the sum of all divisors of `a` greater than or equal to `min`. The `main` function uses a loop to read input numbers, call the `f` function to calculate the sum of divisors for each number, and print the result.
