**Part I**
```c
int prime(int n, int m )
{ 
	// The function prime calculates the sum of the prime factors of a number n, starting from the smallest factor m.
    int i,total=1;
    if(n<m)return 0;  // If n is less than m, there are no prime factors in the range, so return 0
    
    for(i=m;i<=n;i++)
    {
        if(n%i==0)
            total+=prime(n/i,i);  // If i is a factor of n, add the sum of the prime factors of n/i to the total
    }
    return total;  // Return the total sum of the prime factors
}

void main()
{  
    int n,b[2000],b0,i;
    scanf("%d",&n);  // Read an integer from the user and store it in n
    for(i=0;i<=n-1;i++)
    {   
        scanf("%d",&b0);  // Read an integer from the user and store it in b0
        b[i]=prime(b0,2);  // Calculate the sum of the prime factors of b0 and store it in b[i]
    }
    for(i=0;i<=n-2;i++)
    {
        printf("%d\n",b[i]);  // Print each sum of prime factors on a new line
    }
    printf("%d",b[n-1]);  // Print the last sum of prime factors
}
```

**Part II**
This program calculates the sum of prime factors of each prime number from the user's input. The prime function takes an integer n and a start point m, and returns the sum of all prime factors of n that are greater than or equal to m. It does this by starting from m and incrementing the factor by 1 until it finds a factor of n. It then adds the sum of the prime factors of n/i to the total. The main function reads an integer from the user and calculates the sum of prime factors for each prime number from 2 to the user's input. The sums are stored in an array and printed out.
