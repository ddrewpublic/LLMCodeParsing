**Part II (Summary)**

The code implements a function to calculate the count of divisors of a given number. The `fen` function takes two parameters, `x` and `h`, where `x` is the number to be processed and `h` is the lower bound of the divisors to be considered. The function uses a recursive approach to calculate the count of divisors.

The main function reads the number of test cases from the input and processes each test case by calling the `fen` function. The `fen` function calculates the count of divisors for each test case and stores the result in the `cc` variable. The main function then prints the count of divisors for each test case.

The code also includes a loop that resets the `cc` variable to zero at the beginning of each test case. This is necessary because the `fen` function is recursive and may overwrite the value of `cc` in the previous test case.
