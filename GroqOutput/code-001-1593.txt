**Part I: Code with Comments**

```c
int main()
{
    // Declare variables for number of test cases and array
    int n, a[100];
    int i;
    // Declare a function called f that takes two integers and returns an integer
    int f(int x, int min);

    // Initialize array to all zeros
    for(i=0;i<100;i++) {
        a[i] = 0;
    }

    // Read number of test cases
    scanf("%d",&n);

    // Run through each test case
    for(i=0;i<n;i++) {
        // Read number
        scanf("%d",&a[i]);
        // Call function f and assign result to array
        a[i] = f(a[i], 2);
    }

    // Print results
    for(i=0;i<n;i++) {
        printf("%d\n",a[i]);
    }

    // Exit program
    return 0;
}

int f(int x, int min)
{
    // Initialize variables
    int y = 0;
    int i;

    // Base case: if input is 1, return 1
    if(x == 1) {
        y = 1;
    }
    else {
        // Recursive case: loop from min to x
        for(i = min; i <= x; i++) {
            // If x is divisible by i, recursive call f with x/i and i
            if(x % i == 0) {
                y = y + f(x/i, i);
            }
        }
    }

    // Return result
    return y;
}
```
**Part II: Summary**

The provided code is a C program that calculates the sum of proper divisors for each number in an array. The program uses a recursive function `f` to calculate the sum of divisors for each number. The function `f` takes two parameters, `x` and `min`, where `x` is the number for which to calculate the sum of divisors, and `min` is the starting value for the loop that finds the divisors.

The program reads the number of test cases and the numbers for which to calculate the sum of divisors. For each number, it calls the function `f` with the number and the starting value of 2, and assigns the result to an array. Finally, the program prints the results.

The code is designed to handle a large number of test cases and numbers, and it uses a recursive approach to calculate the sum of divisors, which makes it efficient and scalable.
