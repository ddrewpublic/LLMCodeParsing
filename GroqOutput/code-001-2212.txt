Here is the code with developer comments for each line, using the header "Part I" and a 200-word summary with the header "Part II":

**Part I**

```c
int fenjie(int x,int k)
{
    // This function calculates the sum of all divisors of a given number x, excluding k.
    int t=1,i;
    if(k>x)
    {
        // If k is greater than x, return 0 because there are no remaining divisors to sum.
        return 0;
    }
    for(i=k;i<x;i++)
    {
        // Iterate through all numbers from k to x-1.
        if(x%i==0)
        {
            // If the current number is a divisor of x, recursively call fenjie with x divided by i and i as the new x.
            t=t+fenjie(x/i,i);
        }
    }
    return t;
}

int main()
{
    // This is the main function that runs the program.
    int j,p,n,a[101];
    scanf("%d",&n);
    // Read an integer n from the user.
    for(j=0;j<=n-1;j++)
    {
        // Loop n times to read and process n numbers.
        scanf("%d",&a[j]);
        // Read an integer and store it in an array a.
    }
    for(j=0;j<=n-1;j++)
    {
        // Print the sum of divisors for each number in the array, excluding 2.
        printf("%d",fenjie(a[j],2));
        // Print a newline after each output.
        printf("\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
```

**Part II**

This code is a C program designed to calculate the sum of all divisors of a given number, excluding a specified divisor (usually 2). The program first defines a function `fenjie` that takes two integers `x` and `k` as inputs. The function recursively calculates the sum of all divisors of `x` (excluding `k`) and returns the result.

The `main` function reads an integer `n` from the user, which determines the number of test cases. It then reads `n` integers, stores them in an array `a`, and calculates the sum of divisors for each number using the `fenjie` function. The results are printed to the console with a newline after each output.

This program is useful for solving problems related to divisor sums and properties of numbers.
