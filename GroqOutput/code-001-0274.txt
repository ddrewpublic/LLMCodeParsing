Part I:
```
int yinshu(int be,int by)
{
    // Define a function called yinshu that takes two integers, be and by, as input
    int i,sum=0;//cout<<be<<' '<<by<<endl;
    // Initialize two variables, i and sum, to 0 and 0 respectively. The comment is a debug statement that prints the values of be and by

    for(i=by;i*i<=be;i++)
    {
                       // Start a for loop that iterates from by to the square root of be (inclusive)
        if(be%i==0){// If be is divisible by i
            sum+=1+yinshu(be/i,i); // Add 1 to the sum and recursively call yinshu with be replaced by be/i and i as the new input values
        } 
    } 
    // The function returns the total sum
    return sum;
}
int main()
{
    // Define a function called main
    int n,i,j,num,sign
    ;
    // Declare several integer variables: n, i, j, num, and sign
    cin>>n;
    // Read an integer from the console and store it in n

    for(i=0;i<n;i++)
    {
                    // Start a for loop that iterates n times
        cin>>num;for(j=num;j>1;j--)// Read an integer from the console and store it in num
        {if(num%j==0)sign=j;}// If num is divisible by j, store j as the value of sign
        // Print the result of the yinshu function, which is the sum of the proper divisors plus 1
        cout<<yinshu(num,sign)+1<<endl;
    }
    // Read two characters from the console (perhaps for waiting, but don't know for sure since I'm a language model)
    getchar();getchar();
    // The program returns an integer value
    return 0;
}
