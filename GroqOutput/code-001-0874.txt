**Part II: Summary**

This program is designed to calculate the sum of proper divisors of a given number. It first takes an integer input `n` from the user and repeatedly asks for another integer `a` until `n` becomes 0. For each input `a`, it calls the function `f(a, 2)` and prints the output. The function `f(a, b)` calculates the sum of proper divisors of `a` starting from `b` to `a`. If `a` is less than `b`, it returns 0. Otherwise, it iterates over the range from `b` to `a`, adding the divisor `i` to the sum only if `a` is divisible by `i`, and recursively calls itself with the quotient of `a` and `i` and `i`. The final sum is returned by the function.
