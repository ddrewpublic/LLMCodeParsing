```c
int num = 0; // Initialize a variable num to store the count of prime numbers
void f(int k, int n) {
    int i, flag = 0; // Declare variables i and flag
    for (i = k; i <= n; i++) {
        if (n % i == 0) {
            // Check if n is divisible by i
            f(i, n / i); // Recursively call the function with i as the new value of k
            flag = 1; // Set flag to 1 to indicate that n is not a prime number
        }
    }
    if ((flag == 0 && k <= n) || n == 1) {
        // If flag is 0 and k <= n, or n is 1, then num is incremented
        num++;
    }
}

int main() {
    int i, n, m; // Declare variables i, n, and m
    cin >> m; // Read the value of m
    for (i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
        cin >> n; // Read the value of n
        f(2, n); // Call the function f with 2 as the initial value of k
        cout << num << endl; // Print the count of prime numbers
        num = 0; // Reset the count of prime numbers
    }
    return 0;
}
```

**Part II: Summary**

This program is designed to count the number of prime numbers from 2 to a given number n. The function f takes two integers k and n as input and recursively checks if n is divisible by k. If n is divisible by k, it calls itself with i as the new value of k and sets a flag to 1. If the flag is 0 and k <= n, or n is 1, then num is incremented to count the prime numbers. The main function reads the value of m and for each iteration, it reads the value of n, calls the function f with 2 as the initial value of k, prints the count of prime numbers, and resets the count to 0.
