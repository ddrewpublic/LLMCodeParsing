Here is the modified code with developer comments:

**Part I**

```c
int fenjie(int a, int b) {
    // Initialize variable c to 1, which will hold the sum of all divisors of a
    int c = 1;
    int i;

    // Loop through all numbers from b up to and including the square root of a
    for (i = b; i <= (int)sqrt(a); i++) {
        // Check if a is divisible by i
        if (a % i == 0) {
            // Recursively call fenjie with a divided by i and i as arguments
            c += fenjie(a / i, i);
        }
    }

    // Return the sum of all divisors
    return c;
}
```

**Part II: Summary**

This code is a solution to the problem of finding the sum of all divisors of a given number. The function `fenjie` takes two integers `a` and `b` as input, where `b` is the starting number for finding divisors. It initializes a variable `c` to 1, which will hold the sum of all divisors of `a`. The function then loops through all numbers from `b` up to and including the square root of `a`, and for each number `i`, it checks if `a` is divisible by `i`. If it is, the function recursively calls itself with `a` divided by `i` and `i` as arguments. The function then returns the sum of all divisors.

In the `main` function, we read an integer `n` from input, which represents the number of test cases. We then loop through each test case, reading an integer `a` from input, calling the `fenjie` function with `a` and 2 as arguments, and printing the result.
