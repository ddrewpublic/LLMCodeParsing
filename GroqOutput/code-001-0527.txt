**Part I: Code with Developer Comments**

```c
int f(int x,int y){//x and y are inputs to the function
    if((int)pow(x,0.5)<y) return 1;//if square root of x is less than y, return 1
    int d=1;
    for(int i=y;i<=(int)pow(x,0.5);i++)//loop from y to square root of x
        if((x%i)==0)
            d+=f(x/i,i);//if i is a divisor, recursive call with x divided by i and i
    return d;
}

int main(){
    int n,m;
    cin>>n;//read the number of inputs
    for(int k=1;k<=n;k++){
        cin>>m;
        cout<<f(m,2)<<endl;//call function f with m and 2, print the result
    }
    return 0;
}
```

**Part II: 200-word Summary**

This code is designed to solve a problem related to divisors of a number. The function `f(x,y)` returns the sum of all divisors of `x` that are greater than `y`. The function uses a recursive approach to find the divisors.

The function first checks if the square root of `x` is less than `y`. If it is, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it initializes a variable `d` to 1 and loops from `y` to the square root of `x`. For each `i` in the loop, if `i` is a divisor of `x`, the function calls itself recursively with `x` divided by `i` and `i` as inputs, and adds the result to `d`. Finally, the function returns `d`.

The `main` function reads the number of inputs `n` and then reads each input `m`. For each `m`, it calls the `f` function with `m` and 2 as inputs, and prints the result.
