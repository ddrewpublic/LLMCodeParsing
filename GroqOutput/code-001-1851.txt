Here is the code with developer comments:
```
Part I
```

```
int sum=0; // initialize sum variable to 0
void f(int x,int y)
{
	if(x==1) // base case: if x is 1, increment sum
		sum++;
	while(y<=x)
	{
		if(x%y==0) // if x is divisible by y, recursively call f with x/y and y
			f(x/y,y);
		y++;
	}
} // recursive function f to count prime factors
```

```
int main()
{
	int n,i,a; // declare variables n, i, and a
	cin>>n; // read input n
	for(i=1;i<=n;i++)
	{
		cin>>a; // read input a
		int j=2,num=1; // initialize j and num
		while(j<=a/2)
		{
			if(a%j==0) // if a is divisible by j
			{
				sum=0; // reset sum
				f(a/j,j); // recursively count prime factors of a/j
				num+=sum; // add sum to num
			}
			j++;
		}
		printf("\n%d",num); // print num
	}
	return 0; // return 0 to indicate successful execution
}
```
```
Part II
```

The code is designed to calculate the sum of prime factors of each number from 1 to n. The recursive function `f` is used to count the prime factors of a given number. The `main` function reads input n and then iterates through each number from 1 to n, calculating the sum of its prime factors using the `f` function. The result is then printed to the console.

The code has a complexity of O(n log n) due to the use of a loop and recursive function calls. It may not be efficient for large values of n, but it is sufficient for small to medium-sized inputs.
