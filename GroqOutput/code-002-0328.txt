**Part II: Summary**

This program reads a series of book titles and ISBN numbers from the input, counts the frequency of each character in each title, and then finds the character with the maximum frequency. It then prints the character and its frequency, as well as the ISBN numbers of books that contain that character. The program uses a linked list to store the book information, where each node represents a book and contains a string to store the ISBN number and another string to store the book title. The program uses an array to count the frequency of each character in the book titles.
