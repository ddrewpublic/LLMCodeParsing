**Part I**

```c
struct book 
{
    int num;
    char w[100];
}book[100];
```
This line declares a structure called `book` which has two members: `num` of type `int` and `w` of type `char` with a length of 100. An array of this structure called `book` is also declared which can hold up to 100 `book` structures.

```c
void main()
```
This line declares the main function of the program.

```c
int i,j,k,l,m,n,p,b[26]={0};
```
This line declares six integer variables `i`, `j`, `k`, `l`, `m`, and `n`, and three integer arrays `b` and `p` of size 26 and 1 respectively. The array `b` is initialized with all elements as 0.

```c
scanf ("%d\n",&n);
```
This line reads an integer from the standard input and stores it in the variable `n`.

```c
for (i=0;i<n;i++)
{
    scanf ("%d %s",&book[i].num,book[i].w);
}
```
This loop reads `n` number of lines from the standard input. Each line is expected to contain two values separated by a space: the first value is expected to be an integer and the second value is expected to be a string. These values are assigned to the `num` and `w` members of the corresponding `book` structure.

```c
for (i=0;i<n;i++)
{
    for (j=0;book[i].w[j]!='\0';j++)
    {
        ...
    }
}
```
This outer loop iterates over each `book` structure and the inner loop iterates over each character in the `w` member of the structure.

```c
for (i=0;i<=25;i++)
{
    for (j=0;j<26;j++)
    {
        if (b[i]<b[j])
            break;
    }
    if (j==26)
    {
        printf ("%c\n%d\n",65+i,b[i]);
        break;
    }
}
```
This loop finds the first `i` such that `b[i]` is the maximum value in the array `b`. The character corresponding to `i` is then printed along with the value of `b[i]`.

```c
for (j=0;j<n;j++)
{
    for (l=0;book[j].w[l]!='\0';l++)
    {
        if (book[j].w[l]==65+i)
        {
            printf ("%d\n",book[j].num);
            break;
        }
    }
}
```
This loop prints the `num` value of the `book` structure whose `w` member contains the character corresponding to `i`.

**Part II**

The code provided is aimed at solving a problem where a list of books with their respective alphabets are given and the program is expected to find the first alphabet that does not appear in the most frequent book. The main logic is implemented in the third and last for loop. Here is a summary of how the code works.

The program first reads the number of books and then the details of each book. For each book, it counts the frequency of each alphabet and stores it in the array `b`. Then it finds the maximum frequency and the corresponding alphabet. The program then iterates over each book again and prints the number of the book which has the alphabet corresponding to the maximum frequency.
