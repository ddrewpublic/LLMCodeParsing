Here is the output with developer comments and a summary:

**Part I**

```
int count;
```
Declare a variable `count` of type `int`, which will be used to keep track of the number of factors for each number.

```
void fun(int m,int n)
{
    if(m <=sqrt(n)){
        // If m is less than or equal to the square root of n, then we need to check for factors
        for (int a=m;a <=sqrt(n);a++)
        {
            if(n%a==0){
                // If n is divisible by a, then a is a factor of n
                count ++; fun (a,n/a);}
            else 
                // If n is not divisible by a, then we move on to the next number
                count=count; 
        }
    }
    else
        // If m is greater than the square root of n, then we don't need to check for factors anymore
        count=count; 
 }
```

```
main()
{
    int n;scanf("%d",&n);
    // Read the number of test cases
    for (int i =0;i<n;i++)
    {
        // For each test case
        count=0; 
        int num;scanf("%d",&num);
        // Read the number to be checked for factors
        for(int j=2;j<=sqrt(num);j++)
        {
            if(num%j==0)
            {count ++; fun(j,num/j);}
        }
        printf ("%d\n",count+1); 
    }
}
```

**Part II**

The provided code is designed to find the number of factors for a given set of numbers. The `fun` function is a recursive function that checks if a number is divisible by `m`, and if it is, it increments the `count` variable and recursively calls itself with `a` and `n/a` as arguments. The `main` function reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number to be checked and uses the `fun` function to find the number of factors. The `count` variable is incremented for each factor found, and finally, the total count is printed out.
