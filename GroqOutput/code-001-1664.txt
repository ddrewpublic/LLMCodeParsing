**Part I**

```
void factor(int,int);
int result[9999]={0};
int j=0;
```

* We declare a function `factor` that takes two integer parameters, and define an integer array `result` with 9999 elements initialized to 0. We also define a variable `j` and initialize it to 0.

```
int main()
{
```

* We start the main function, which is the entry point of the program.

```
    int times,k=1;
    cin>>times;
```

* We declare two integer variables `times` and `k`, and initialize `k` to 1. We then read an integer value from the input stream and store it in `times`.

```
    while(k<=times){
```

* We start a loop that will iterate from 1 to `times` (exclusive).

```
        int num,ansf=0;
        cin>>num;
```

* We declare two integer variables `num` and `ansf`, and initialize `ansf` to 0. We then read an integer value from the input stream and store it in `num`.

```
        factor(2,num);
```

* We call the `factor` function with arguments 2 and `num`.

```
        for(int i=0;i<9999;i++)
            if(result[i])ansf++;
```

* We iterate through the `result` array and increment `ansf` for each non-zero element.

```
        cout<<ansf<<endl;
```

* We print the value of `ansf` followed by a newline character.

```
        for(int i=0;i<9999;i++)
            result[i]=0;
```

* We reset the `result` array by setting each element to 0.

```
        k++;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

* We increment `k` and repeat the loop until `k` exceeds `times`. Finally, we return 0 to indicate successful program execution.

**Part II**

This program is designed to factorize numbers and count the number of factors for each number in a given range. The main function repeatedly reads an integer value from the input stream, calls the `factor` function to factorize the number, and then counts the number of non-zero elements in the `result` array to obtain the number of factors. The result is then printed to the output stream.

The `factor` function is a recursive function that takes two integer parameters, `start` and `num`. It factors `num` starting from `start` and repeatedly calls itself until `num` is reduced to 1. The factors are stored in the `result` array, and the number of non-zero elements in the array represents the number of factors.
