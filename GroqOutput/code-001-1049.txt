**Part I**
```
int sum[50];
int i;
int main()
{
	void digui(int x, int y);
```
* Declaration of a global array `sum` to store the sum of divisors for each number.

```
int n;
int j[50],m[50];
```
* Declaration of three integer arrays: `n` to store the number of elements, `j` to store the possible divisors, and `m` to store the input numbers.

```
scanf("%d",&n);
```
* Read the number of elements `n` from the input.

```
for(i=0;i<n;i++)
{	
	scanf("%d",&m[i]);
	sum[i]=0;
```
* Read each number `m[i]` from the input and initialize a variable `sum[i]` to 0.

```
	for (j[i]=2;j[i]*j[i]<=m[i];j[i])
	{
		if(m[i]%j[i]==0)
		{
			sum[i]++;
			digui(j[i],m[i]/j[i]);
		}
	}
```
* Iterate through the possible divisors `j[i]` from 2 to the square root of `m[i]`. If `m[i]` is divisible by `j[i]`, increment the `sum[i]` and recursively call the `digui` function with `j[i]` and `m[i]/j[i]`.

```
	printf("%d\n",sum[i]+1);
```
* Print the number of divisors for `m[i]` (including 1 and the number itself) adding 1 to `sum[i]`.

```
return 0;
}
```
* End of the `main` function and return 0 to indicate successful execution.

**void digui(int x, int y)**

```
int s;
```
* Declaration of a local integer variable `s` to store the possible divisor.

```
for(s=x; s*s<=y; s++) 
{
```
* Iterate through the possible divisors `s` from `x` to the square root of `y`.

```
	if(y%s==0) 
	{
```
* If `y` is divisible by `s`, increment the `sum[i]` and recursively call the `digui` function with `s` and `y/s`.

```
		sum[i]++;
		digui(s,y/s);
	}
}
```
* End of the `digui` function.

**Part II**

This code is a simple implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to calculate the sum of divisors for a given set of numbers. The `digui` function is used recursively to find the divisors of a number. The `main` function reads the number of elements and each number, then iterates through the possible divisors for each number, incrementing the `sum` array and recursively calling the `digui` function.

The output of the program will be the number of divisors for each input number, including 1 and the number itself. This code can be used to find the sum of divisors for a set of numbers, which can be useful in various mathematical and programming applications.
