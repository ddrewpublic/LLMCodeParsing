```c
int main()
{
    // Function prototype for the recursive function 'brea'
    int brea(int a, int min);

    // Declaration of variables
    int i, n, a;

    // Read the number of inputs from the user
    scanf("%d", &n);

    // Loop through each input and call the 'brea' function
    for (i = 1; i <= n; i++)
    {
        // Read each input value
        scanf("%d", &a);

        // Print the result of the 'brea' function
        printf("%d\n", brea(a, 2));
    }
}

int brea(int a, int min)
{
    // Initialize the result variable
    int result = 1;

    // Declaration of a variable 'i'
    int i;

    // Base cases
    if (a < min)
        return (0);
    else if (a == min)
        return (1);

    // Recursive case
    else
    {
        // Loop from 'min' to 'a'
        for (i = min; i < a; i++)
        {
            // Check if 'a' is divisible by 'i'
            if (a % i == 0)
            {
                // Recursively call 'brea' with 'a/i' and 'i' as arguments
                result = result + brea(a / i, i);
            }
        }

**Part II: Summary**

The provided code is a C program that solves the problem of finding the number of divisors for a given integer. The program uses a recursive function `brea` to achieve this. 

The function `brea` takes two integer arguments, `a` and `min`, where `a` is the input number and `min` is the minimum divisor. The function returns the number of divisors of `a`. 

The program first reads the number of inputs from the user and then iterates through each input. For each input, it calls the function `brea` with the input value and 2 as arguments, and prints the result. 

The function `brea` uses a combination of base cases and recursive calls to calculate the number of divisors. The base cases are when `a` is less than `min` or when `a` is equal to `min`, in which case the function returns 0 and 1 respectively. 

In the recursive case, the function loops from `min` to `a`, checks if `a` is divisible by the current number, and if so, recursively calls itself with `a/i` and `i` as arguments. The results of these recursive calls are added to the result variable, which is finally returned.
