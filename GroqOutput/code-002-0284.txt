Here is the code with developer comments for each line in "Part I", along with a 200-word summary in "Part II".

**Part I**

```c
struct book
{
    long int num;
    char name[26];
}book[1000]; // Define a struct called book with two fields: num (long int) and name (character array of size 26). Create an array of 1000 book structs.

int main()
{
    int m,i,j,r;
    int writer[26]={0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0}; // Declare an array writer of size 26 to count the occurrences of each letter in the book names.
    scanf("%d",&m); // Read the number of books (m) to be processed.
    for(i=0;i<m;i++)
    {
        scanf("%ld ",&book[i].num); // Read the book number for each book.
        scanf("%s",book[i].name); // Read the book name for each book.
    }
    for(i=0;i<m;i++)
    {
        r=strlen(book[i].name); // Get the length of the book name.
        for(j=0;j<r;j++)
        {
            writer[book[i].name[j]-'A']++; // Count the occurrences of each letter in the book name.
        }
    }
    int max=0;
    char w='A';
    for(i=0;i<26;i++)
    {
        if(writer[i]>max)
        {
            max=writer[i];
            w=i+'A';
        }
    }    
    printf("%c\n",w);
    printf("%d\n",max); // Print the most common character and its count.
    for(i=0;i<m;i++)
    {
        for(j=0;j<r;j++)
        {
            r=strlen(book[i].name);
            if(book[i].name[j]==w)
            {
                printf("%ld\n",book[i].num); // Print the book numbers for each book that has the most common character in its name.
            }
        }
    }

**Part II**

This program reads a list of book names and their numbers, and finds the most common character in the book names. It then prints this character and its count, as well as the book numbers for each book that has this character in its name.

The program starts by reading the number of books (m) and then processes each book name and number. For each book, it counts the occurrences of each letter in the name using the array writer. It then finds the maximum count and the corresponding character, which is the most common character.

The program then prints the most common character and its count, and finally prints the book numbers for each book that has this character in its name. The program assumes that the book names only contain letters (uppercase and lowercase) and do not contain any other characters.

Note that the program is case-sensitive, meaning that uppercase and lowercase letters are treated differently. Also, the program does not handle book names that are longer than 26 characters, since the book struct's name field is only 26 characters long.
