**Part II: Summary**

The code provided is a C program that calculates the number of divisors for a given positive integer. It uses a recursive function `work()` to find the number of divisors for a given number `p`. The function works by iterating through all numbers from `k` to `p` and checking if `p` is divisible by each number. If it is, the function recursively calls itself with `p/i` and `i` as arguments. The base case for the recursion is when `p` is 1, in which case the function increments the answer by 1 and returns the updated value of `p` and `k`.

The main function takes an integer `n` as input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` from input and calls the `work()` function with `t` and 2 as arguments. The number of divisors is then printed to the output. The program uses a global variable `ans` to store the number of divisors for each test case.
