**Part II: Summary**

The code provided is a C++ program that calculates the sum of the divisors of a given number `a` excluding `a` itself for all numbers in a given set. The program uses a recursive function `s(a, b)` to calculate the sum of divisors for each number `a` in the set, with `b` being the starting divisor for the recursive calculation. The function returns 1 if `a` is 1 and 0 otherwise. The main function reads a set of numbers from the input and prints the sum of divisors for each number in the set. The program is designed to handle a set of numbers, each with its unique divisor calculation, which is a unique feature of this code. The output of the program will display the sum of divisors for each number in the set.
