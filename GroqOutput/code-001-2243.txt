Here is the code with developer comments and a summary:

**Part I: Code with Comments**

```c
int devide(int n, int k)
{
    // Initialize the sum variable
    int s, i;
    // Initialize the sum to 1 (which is the smallest divisor)
    s = 1;
    // Loop from k to the square root of n (inclusive)
    for (i = k; i <= sqrt(n * 1.0); i++)
    {
        // Check if n is divisible by i
        if (n % i == 0)
        {
            // If it is, recursively call devide with n/i and i as arguments
            s = s + devide(n / i, i);
        }
    }
    // Return the sum of divisors
    return s;
}

int main()
{
    // Initialize the number of test cases
    int n, a[200], i;
    // Read the number of test cases
    scanf("%d", &n);
    // Loop through each test case
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        // Read the number for the current test case
        scanf("%d", &a[i]);
        // Print the sum of divisors for the current test case (except 2)
        if (i == 0) printf("%d", devide(a[i], 2));
        else printf("\n%d", devide(a[i], 2));
    }
    // Return 0 to indicate success
    return 0;
}
```

**Part II: Summary**

This code is a simple implementation of a function to calculate the sum of divisors of a given number, including the number itself. The `devide` function takes two arguments, `n` and `k`, and recursively finds the sum of divisors of `n` up to `k`. The `main` function reads a number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads a number and prints the sum of its divisors (except 2). The code uses a simple recursive approach to find the sum of divisors, which may not be efficient for large numbers.
