**Part I**

```c
int times=1;
// Initialize a variable times to 1 for counting the number of prime factors.

int used[1000]={0};
// Declare an array used of size 1000 and initialize all elements to 0 to keep track of used numbers.

void fuck(int n)
{
	int i=0;
	// Initialize a loop variable i to 0.

	for (i=2;i<=sqrt(n);i++)
	{
	// Loop through all numbers less than or equal to the square root of the input number n.

		if (used[i]==0&&n%i==0)
		{
			// If the current number i is not used and n is divisible by i, it's a prime factor.
			int j=0;
			// Initialize a new loop variable j to 0.
			for (j=0;j<=i-1;j++)
				used[j]=1;
			// Mark all numbers from 2 to i as used.
			times++;
			// Increment the times variable to count the number of prime factors.
			fuck(n/i);
			// Recursively call the function with the remaining number n/i.
			for (j=0;j<=i-1;j++)
				used[j]=0;
			// Reset the used numbers to 0.
		}
	}
}
```

**Part II - Summary**

This C++ program is designed to calculate the number of prime factors for a given sequence of positive integers. The `fuck` function is recursive and repeatedly divides the input number by its prime factors until it reaches 1. The `used` array keeps track of used numbers to avoid checking the same factor multiple times. The `main` function reads a sequence of numbers from the input, calls the `fuck` function for each number, and prints the result. After processing each number, the used array is reset to keep track of the prime factors for the next number in the sequence. The program is efficient as it only checks numbers up to the square root of the input number, which reduces the time complexity.
