**Part I**

```c
int s=0,p=1;
```

* Initializations of variables s and p. Variable s is used to count the number of prime factors and variable p is used to accumulate the total number of prime factors.

```c
void fenjie(int a,int b)
{
    int i;
    if(a==1)
        s++;
```

* A function called fenjie that counts the number of prime factors of a number.
* The base case is when a equals 1, in which case it increments the count s.

```c
    for(i=b;i<=a;i++)
        if(a%i==0) fenjie(a/i,i);
```

* Recursively calls the function fenjie to check if a is divisible by any number from b to a.
* When a is divisible by a number, it recursively calls fenjie with the quotient and the current number.

```c
    return;
}
```

* Returns the control back to the previous function call.

```c
int main()
{
    int n,i,j,a[100];
    scanf("%d",&n);
```

* Declaration of an array a of size 100 to store the numbers.
* Reads the number of test cases n.

```c
    for(i=0;i<n;i++)
    {
        scanf("%d",&a[i]);
```

* Reads each test case number.
* Initializes p to 1, expecting the total count of prime factors.

```c
        for(j=2;j*j<=a[i];j++)
        {
            if(a[i]%j==0)
            {
                s=0;
```

* Checks if a number has any prime factors.
* Initializes s to 0 for each test case.

```c
                fenjie(a[i]/j,j);
                p=p+s;
            }
```

* Calls the fenjie function to count the prime factors and updates the count p.

```c
        printf("%d\n",p);
        p=1;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

* Prints the total count of prime factors for each test case.
* Resets p to 1 for the next test case.
* Ends the program.

**Part II**

This code is designed to solve a specific problem in prime number theory. It takes in a list of numbers and prints the total count of prime factors for each number. The prime factorization of each number is calculated using a recursive function fenjie. The code is efficient, but the implementation can be optimized for larger inputs.
