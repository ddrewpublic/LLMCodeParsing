Here is the code with developer comments added for each line:

```c
// This is an array of structures, where each structure represents a book with a number and a name.
struct book
{
    int num;
    char name[27];
} book[1000];
```

```c
// This is the main function where the program execution begins.
int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
```

```c
    // Initialize an integer array a with all values as 0.
    int m, i, j, a[27], len, max = 0, number;
    char p;
```

```c
    // Initialize all elements of the array 'a' to 0.
    for(i=1;i<=26;i++){
        a[i] = 0;
    }
```

```c
    // Read the number of books 'm' from the user.
    scanf("%d", &m);
```

```c
    // This loop reads the details of each book and counts the frequency of its letters.
    for(i=1;i<=m;i++){
        scanf("%d %s", &book[i].num, &book[i].name);
        len = strlen(book[i].name);
        for(j=0;j<=len-1;j++){
            p = book[i].name[j];
            a[p-64] += 1;
        }
    }
```

```c
    // This loop finds the maximum frequency and the corresponding letter.
    for(i=1;i<=26;i++){
        if(a[i] > max){
            max = a[i];
            number = i;
        }
    }
```

```c
    // Print the letter with the maximum frequency and the number of books that have that letter.
    printf("%c\n%d\n", number+64, a[number]);
```

```c
    // This loop prints the numbers of the books that have the letter with the maximum frequency.
    for(i=1;i<=m;i++){
        len = strlen(book[i].name);
        for(j=0;j<=len-1;j++){
            if(book[i].name[j] == number+64){
                printf("%d\n", book[i].num);
            }
        }
    }
```

```c
    // This is the end of the main function and the program execution.
    return 0;
}
```

**Part II: Summary**

This program reads the details of multiple books, including their numbers and names, and then finds the letter that appears most frequently in the names of the books. It then prints the letter and the numbers of the books that have that letter. The program uses an array to count the frequency of each letter in the names of the books, and then finds the maximum frequency and the corresponding letter.
