**Part I**

```c
int cal(int M, int N) {
    // Define a function cal that takes two integer parameters M and N 
    int i;
    int num = 0; 
    // Initialize an integer variable num to 0 
    if (M == 1) return 0;
    // If M is 1, return 0 because the sum of divisors for 1 is 0
    if (N >= M) return (1 + cal(M, M - 1));
    // If N is greater than or equal to M, recursively call cal with M and M-1
    for (i = 2; i < M; i++) {
        // Iterate from 2 to M-1 
        if (M % i == 0 && i <= N) num = num + cal(M / i, i);
        // If M is divisible by i and i is less than or equal to N, recursively call cal with M/i and i
    }
    return num;
    // Return the sum of divisors for M
}
```

**Part II**

This program calculates the sum of all proper divisors of a given number M, where a proper divisor is a divisor that is not equal to the number itself. The function cal(M, N) takes two parameters: M, the number for which the sum of divisors is to be calculated, and N, the upper limit for the divisors.
The program starts by checking if M is equal to 1. If so, it returns 0 because the sum of divisors for 1 is 0. Then it checks if N is greater than or equal to M. If so, it recursively calls cal(M, M-1) and adds 1 to the result, because all divisors greater than M are already included in the recursive call.
The program then iterates from 2 to M-1, and for each i, checks if M is divisible by i and i is less than or equal to N. If so, it recursively calls cal(M/i, i) to calculate the sum of the divisors of M/i and adds the result to the sum num.
The program then returns the sum of the divisors for M.
