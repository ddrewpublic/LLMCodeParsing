**Part I**

```c
int factor(int n,int min); // function prototype for factor function
int main()
{
    int n,num; // declare variables n and num
    cin>>n; // read input for integer n
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
    {
        cin>>num; // read input for integer num
        cout<<factor(num,2)<<endl; // calculate and print factor using function factor
    }
    return 0; // end of main function
}
```

**Part II**

Summary:

This code is a C++ program that calculates the sum of all divisors for a given set of numbers. The program uses a recursive function named "factor" to calculate the sum of divisors. The function takes two integer parameters, "n" and "min", where "n" is the number to calculate the sum of divisors for and "min" is the minimum divisor to consider.

The main function takes an integer "n" as input and reads a set of numbers from the user. For each number, it calls the "factor" function with the number and 2 as arguments, and prints the result.
