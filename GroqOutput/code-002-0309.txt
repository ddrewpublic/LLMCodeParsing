```c

    // Initialize variables
    int m, i, j, k = 0;

    // Declare a struct to store book information
    struct
    {
        int n;  // book number
        char s[26];      // book title
    } book[999];

    // Read the number of books from input
    scanf("%d", &m);

    // Read book information (number and title)
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++)
        scanf("%d %s", &book[i].n, &book[i].s);

    // Initialize an array to store frequency of each letter
    int a[26] = {0};

    // Count the frequency of each letter in all book titles
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++)
        for (j = 0; book[i].s[j] != '\0'; j++)
            a[(int)(book[i].s[j] - 'A')]++;
}
```

**Part II: Summary**

This C program reads information about a collection of books, including the book number and title. It then analyzes the titles to find the most frequently occurring letter. The program uses a struct to store book information and an array to keep track of the frequency of each letter. It uses nested loops to iterate through each book and count the frequency of each letter. The program then prints the most frequently occurring letter and the book numbers that contain that letter.
