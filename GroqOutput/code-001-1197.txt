**Part II: Summary**

This program is designed to calculate the number of ways to express a number as a product of prime numbers. The function `fenjie` takes two parameters, `q1` and `n1`, where `q1` is the starting point and `n1` is the number to be broken down. The function returns the number of ways to express `n1` as a product of prime numbers starting from `q1`.

The function uses a recursive approach to find the prime factors of `n1` and calculates the sum of the ways to express `n1` as a product of these prime factors. The main function reads the number of test cases and the current number, and then calls the `fenjie` function to calculate the result.

The output of the program is the number of ways to express each number as a product of prime numbers, with 1 added to include the number itself. This program can be useful in solving problems involving prime factorization and combinatorics.
