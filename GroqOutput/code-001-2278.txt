**Part I**

```c
int f(int,int); // function declaration for f(int, int)
int main()
{
    int N; // variable declaration for N
	cin>>N; // taking input for N from the user
    int i; // variable declaration for i
    for(i=1;i<=N;i++)
    {
        // loop to execute N times
        int a; // variable declaration for a
        cin>>a; // taking input for a from the user
        cout<<f(a,2)<<endl; // calling function f and printing the output
    }
    return 0; // returning 0 to indicate successful execution
}
```

**Part II**

This code is a solution for a programming problem where the user needs to calculate the sum of proper divisors of a number, except for the number itself. The program prompts the user for an integer `N`, and then takes `N` inputs and calculates the sum of divisors for each of those inputs. For each input, the function `f(a,2)` is called, which returns the sum of proper divisors of `a` (excluding `a` itself).

The function `f(n,m)` takes two integers `n` and `m` as parameters. It calculates the sum of proper divisors of `n` by recursively dividing `n` by `m` until `m` is greater than the square root of `n`. If `n` is divisible by `m`, it recursively calls itself with `n/m` and `m`. This process continues until `m` is greater than the square root of `n`, at which point the function returns the calculated sum of divisors.
