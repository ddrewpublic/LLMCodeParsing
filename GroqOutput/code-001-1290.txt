**Part I**

```c
int factorize(int n,int j)
{	
    // Initialize the variable F to 1
    int F=1;
    // Loop until j becomes greater than the square root of n
    for(;j<=sqrt(n);j++)
        // If n is divisible by j, recursively call the function
        if(n%j==0)
            // Add the result of the recursive call to F
            F+=factorize(n/j,j);
    return F; 
}

int main()
{
    // Declare an array of integers n of size 1000
    int i,m,n[1000];
    // Read the value of m
    scanf("%d",&m);
    // Read m values from the user and store them in the array n
    for(i=0;i<m;i++)
        scanf("%d",&n[i]);
    // Loop through each value in the array n
    for(i=0;i<m;i++)
        // Print the result of factorizing each value using the function factorize
        printf("%d\n",factorize(n[i],2));
    return 0;
}
```

**Part II**

This program is designed to factorize positive integers using the recursive function `factorize`. The function takes two arguments, `n` and `j`, where `n` is the integer to be factorized and `j` is the current factor being checked. The function returns the sum of the factors of `n`.

In the `main` function, the user is prompted to input a value `m` and then `m` numbers. Each number is then factorized using the `factorize` function and the result is printed to the console.

The time complexity of this program is O(sqrt(n)) because the loop in the `factorize` function continues until `j` becomes greater than the square root of `n`. The space complexity is O(log(n)) due to the recursive function calls.

Note that the program only factors odd numbers as it starts from 2 and checks for divisibility up to the square root of `n`. This is because a larger factor of `n` must be a multiple of a smaller factor that has already been checked.
