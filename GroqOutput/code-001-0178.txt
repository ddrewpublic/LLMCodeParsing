Part I

int num,s=1; // Initialize num to 0 and s to 1

void divide(int n,int a) // Function to find the number of divisors of a number
{
  for(int i=n;i<=a/s;i++)// Loop through the range from n to a divided by s
  {
    s*=i; 
    if(s==a) // If the product of i and previous numbers is equal to a, increment num
      num++;
    else if(s<a && a%s==0) // If the product is less than a and a is divisible by s, recursively call divide
      divide(i,a);
    s/=i; // Update s to the result of s divided by i
  }
}

int main() // Main function
{
  int n,i,a;
  cin>>n; // Read the number of inputs

  for(i=0;i<n;i++)
  {
    num=0; // Reset num to 0 for each input
    cin>>a; // Read the input number
    divide(2,a); // Find the number of divisors for the input number
    cout<<num<<endl; 
  }
  return 0;
}

```

Part II

The code is designed to find the number of divisors for a given number. The function "divide" recursively finds the number of divisors for the number by looping through the range from n to a divided by the current product, and updates the product by multiplying it with the current number and then dividing it by the current number. The number of divisors is incremented whenever the product becomes equal to the input number. If the product is less than the input number and the input number is divisible by the product, the function is called recursively. The process continues until the product equals or exceeds the input number. Finally, the number of divisors is printed for each input number.
