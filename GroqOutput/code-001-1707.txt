Here is the code with comments added to explain each line, with a 200-word summary placed under the "Part II" header:

```cpp
Part I:

const int mov[4][2] = {{-1, 0}, {0, -1}, {1, 0}, {0, 1}};
int m, n, counter;

void dfs(int m, int i) {
    //cout << m << ' ' << n << endl;  // Print the current value of m and n
    if (m == 1) {
        ++counter;  // Increment the counter when m becomes 1
        return;
    }
    for (;i <= m; ++i) {
        if (m % i == 0) {
            dfs(m/i, i);  // Recursively call dfs with m/i and i
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    int t, m, n;
    cin >> t;  // Read the number of test cases
    while (t--) {
        counter = 0;  // Reset the counter for each test case
        cin >> m;  // Read the current value of m
        dfs(m, 2);  // Call dfs with the current value of m and 2
        cout << counter << endl;  // Print the final value of the counter
    }
}
```

Part II:

This code is used to solve a problem related to prime numbers. The dfs function is a helper function that performs Depth-First Search on the numbers to determine the total number of divisors for a given number m. The main function reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the value of m and calls the dfs function to calculate the total number of divisors. The count of divisors is then printed. The problem can be solved simply by iterating from 1 to the square root of m and checking if m is divisible by the number. However, this code uses a recursive function to solve the problem.
