**Part I**
```
int m,n,num;
```
* Declare three integer variables: `m`, `n`, and `num`. These variables will be used to store input values and accumulate results.

```
void dfs(int i,int j)
{
    int x;
```
* Define a recursive function `dfs` that takes two integer parameters `i` and `j`. This function will perform a depth-first search to find all divisors of `i`.

```
    if (i==1)
    {
        num++;
        return;
    }
```
* If `i` is equal to 1, increment the `num` variable and exit the function. This is the base case of the recursion.

```
    for (x=j;x<=i;x++)
    {
        if (i%x==0)
        dfs(i/x,x);
    }
}
```
* Loop through all numbers from `j` to `i` (inclusive) and check if `i` is divisible by the current number `x`. If it is, recursively call `dfs` with `i` divided by `x` and `x` as the new `i` and `j` values, respectively.

**Part II**

This code is used to find all divisors of a given number `n`. It does so by performing a depth-first search starting from `n` and gradually dividing the current number by each divisor found until it reaches 1.

The program reads an integer `m` from the user and then repeatedly reads a number `n` and finds all its divisors using the `dfs` function. The results are printed to the console.

The `dfs` function uses a recursive approach to find divisors. For each number `i`, it checks each divisor `x` from `j` to `i` and recursively calls itself with `i` divided by `x` and `x` as the new `i` and `j` values. The base case is when `i` is equal to 1, at which point the function increments the `num` variable to track the total number of divisors.

Overall, this code provides a simple and efficient way to find all divisors of a given number.
