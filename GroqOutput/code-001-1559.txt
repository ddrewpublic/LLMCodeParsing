**Part I: Code with comments**

```c
int p=0,q=2;  // Initialize variables p and q to 0 and 2 respectively

int jizu(int x)
{ 
  for(int i=q;i<=x-1;i++)  // Iterate from q to x-1
  { 
     if((x%i==0)&&(x/i>i))  // Check if x is divisible by i and if i is greater than x/i
      {
        p++;  // Increment p if the condition is met
        q=i;  // Update q to be the current value of i
        jizu(x/i);  // Recursively call jizu with x/i as the new input
        
      }
      else if((x%i==0)&&(x/i==i))   // Check if x is divisible by i and if x/i is equal to i
       {
         p++;  // Increment p if the condition is met
       }
   }
  return p;    // Return the final value of p
}

int main()
{
  int n;  // Declare variable n
  scanf("%d",&n);  // Read the value of n from the user

  int a[100];  // Declare an array a of size 100
  for(int i=0;i<=n-1;i++)  // Iterate n times
   {
     scanf("%d",&a[i]);      // Read the value of a[i] from the user
   }
  for(int i=0;i<=n-1;i++)  // Iterate n times again
   {
    printf("%d\n",jizu(a[i])+1);  // Call jizu with a[i] as the input and print the result+1
     p=0,q=2;      // Reset p and q to 0 and 2 respectively for the next iteration
   }  
  int y;  // Declare variable y
  scanf("%d",&y);      // Read the value of y from the user
}
```

**Part II: Summary**

The given code is a C program that calculates the number of prime factors of a given integer and prints the result. The prime factorization of a number is the decomposition of the number into the product of its prime factors. The program uses a recursive function jizu to find the number of prime factors of a given input. The function jizu takes an integer as input and returns the number of prime factors. The main function reads the input from the user, calls jizu to find the number of prime factors, and prints the result. The program resets the variables p and q to 0 and 2 respectively at the beginning of each iteration to ensure accurate calculations. The variable y is also used to read the input from the user, but its purpose is not clear from the given code.
