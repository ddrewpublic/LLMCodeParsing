**Part II: Summary**

This code calculates the number of divisors for a given number. The function `yinshu` takes two integers, `be` and `by`, as input and returns the number of divisors for `be`. The function uses a recursive approach to count the divisors, starting from `by` and incrementing until the square of `by` is less than `be`. The main function reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads a number and finds its greatest divisor using a loop. The `yinshu` function is then called with the original number and its greatest divisor, and the result is printed. The `+1` at the end is to include the number 1 as a divisor. The code provides an efficient way to calculate the number of divisors for a given number.
