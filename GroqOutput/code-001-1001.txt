Here is the code with developer comments for each line:

```
// This is the main function where the program starts executing
void main()
{
    // Declare an integer variable to store the number of elements
    int n,a[100],i;

    // Declare a function to factorize the number
    void fen(int a[],int x);

    // Read the number of elements from the input
    scanf("%d",&n);

    // Read the elements from the input
    for(i=0;i<n;i++)
    {
        scanf("%d",&a[i]);
    }

    // Call the function to factorize the numbers
    fen(a,n);
}

// This is the function to factorize the number
void fen(int a[],int x)
{
    // Declare integer variables to store the number, factor and total
    int k,b=2,c,t;

    // Declare a helper function to calculate the total factors
    int look(int x,int y);

    // Loop through each number in the array
    for(k=0;k<x;k++)
    {
        // Get the current number from the array
        c=a[k];

        // Calculate the total factors of the current number
        t=look(c,b);

        // Print the total factors
        printf("%d\n",t);
    }
}

// This is the helper function to calculate the total factors
int look(int x,int y)
{
    // Initialize the total factors to 1
    int total=1,p;

    // Check if the number is divisible by the factor
    if(x/y==0)
    {
        // If not divisible, return 0
        return 0;
    }
    else
    {
        // Loop through the factors and calculate the total factors
        for(p=y;p<x;p++)
        {
            // If the number is divisible by the factor, add the total factors of the quotient to the total
            if(x%p==0)
            {
                total=total+look(x/p,p);
            }

    // Return the total factors
    return total;
}
```

Here is the summary:

**Part II**

This program is designed to factorize a set of numbers and calculate the total number of factors for each number. The program starts by reading the number of elements from the input and then reading the elements themselves. It then calls a function "fen" to factorize each number in the array. The "fen" function uses a helper function "look" to calculate the total factors of each number. The "look" function iterates through the factors of the number and recursively calculates the total factors of the quotient until it reaches 1. The total factors for each number are then printed to the console.
