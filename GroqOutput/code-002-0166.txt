```c
struct m {
  int no, j;
  char a[27];
};  // define a struct called m with two integer variables no and j, and a character array a of size 27

main() {
  int n, k, i, j, no, ath[26] = {0}, m;
  char *t, a[26];
  struct m *head, *p1, *p2, *tp, *q;  // declare multiple variables of different types

  scanf("%d", &n);
  head = (struct m*)calloc(n, sizeof(struct m));  // dynamically allocate memory for an array of n struct m's

  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    scanf("%d%s", &(head + i)->no, (head + i)->a);  // read an integer and a string from the user
    (head + i)->j = 0;
    for (t = (head + i)->a; *t != '\0'; t++) {
      ath[(*t) - 'A']++;  // count the occurrence of each character in the string
    }
  }
  for (m = ath[0], k = 0, i = 1; i < 26; i++) {
    if (ath[i] > m) { k = i; m = ath[i]; }  // find the character with the highest frequency
  }
  printf("%c", 'A' + k);

Summary

This C program reads a number of strings from the user and outputs the character that appears most frequently in any of the strings, along with the indices of the strings in which that character appears.
