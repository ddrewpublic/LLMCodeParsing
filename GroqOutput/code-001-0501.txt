Here is the code with developer comments added for each line, using the header "Part I":

**Part I**

```cpp
/*
 * fenjie.cpp
 *
 *  Created on: 2010-11-28
 *      Author: ????
 *      function: ???
 */
```

* This is the header of the code file, which includes the name, creation date, and author information.

```cpp
int solutionNumber(int a,int k){//??????????????
```

* This line declares a function named `solutionNumber` that takes two integer parameters, `a` and `k`.

```cpp
	int i;
```

* This line declares an integer variable `i`.

```cpp
	if(a==1) return 1;
```

* This line checks if the parameter `a` is equal to 1. If true, the function returns 1.

```cpp
	if(k>a) return 0;
```

* This line checks if the parameter `k` is greater than `a`. If true, the function returns 0.

```cpp
	for(i=k;i<=a;i++)
	    if(a%i==0) return solutionNumber(a,i+1)+solutionNumber(a/i,i);
```

* This loop iterates from `k` to `a`, and for each iteration, checks if `a` is divisible by `i`. If it is, the function returns the sum of two recursive calls to itself with updated arguments.

**Part II**

This code implements a function to solve the problem of finding the total number of integers less than or equal to `a` that are divisible by `k` or some of its factors. The function `solutionNumber` recursively counts the factors of `a` and returns the result.

The `main` function takes an integer `n` as input, then reads `n` integers from the input stream and calls the `solutionNumber` function for each one, starting from 2. The results are then printed to the output stream.

The purpose of this code is to solve a specific problem that requires counting factors of integers, and the function `solutionNumber` is designed to achieve this goal. The `main` function provides a simple interface to test the function with different input values.
