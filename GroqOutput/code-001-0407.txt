**Part II: Summary**

This program calculates the number of varieties of each number input by the user. A variety is defined as the number of ways a number can be factored into its prime factors. The program uses a recursive function, `factor`, to find the prime factors of a number. It starts factoring from 2 and recursively finds factors until the number becomes 1. The program then outputs the number of varieties for each input number. The main function takes an input number `n` and processes `n` numbers, outputting the number of varieties for each.
