**Part II: Summary**

The code calculates the sum of all divisors of a given number `k` less than or equal to a starting number `m`. The function `f` takes two arguments `m` and `n` and recursively calculates the sum of all divisors from `m` to `n`. The base case is when `n` is 1, in which case the function returns 1. Otherwise, it loops from `m` to `n`, checking if `n` is divisible by each number `i`. If it is, the function calls itself with `i` and `n/i` and adds the result to the total sum. The main function reads `n` inputs, each of which is a number `k`, and prints the sum of all divisors of `k` less than or equal to `k`. The starting number `m` is fixed at 2.
