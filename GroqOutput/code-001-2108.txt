Here is the code with developer comments:

**Part I: Code**

```c
int fenjie(int x,int p); // Function prototype for fenjie function
int N; // Global variable N
int main()
{
    int n,i; // Declare variables n and i
    scanf("%d",&n); // Read an integer from the input and store it in n
    for(i=0;i<n;i++) // Loop n times
        {scanf("%d",&N); // Read an integer from the input and store it in N
         printf("%d\n",fenjie(N,2)); // Call fenjie function with N and 2 as arguments
        }
    return 0; // Return 0 to indicate successful execution
}
int fenjie(int x,int p)
{
    int f=0; // Initialize variable f to 0
    if(x==1)
        return 1; // If x is 1, return 1
    else
        {for(int i=p;i<=x;i++) // Loop from p to x
           if(x%i==0) // If x is divisible by i
            f=f+fenjie(x/i,i); // Recursive call to fenjie with x/i and i as arguments
        }
    return f; // Return the result of the recursive calls
}
```

**Part II: Summary**

The given code is a C program that calculates the sum of all proper divisors of a given integer, excluding 1 and the number itself. The program reads an integer n from the input and then reads n integers from the input, calculates the sum of all proper divisors for each integer using the fenjie function, and prints the results. The fenjie function uses a recursive approach to find all proper divisors and calculate their sum. The program uses a loop to iterate n times, calling the fenjie function each time with the current integer and the value 2 as arguments. The results are then printed on the console.

Note that the fenjie function does not handle the case where x is a prime number correctly, as it may lead to infinite recursion. A more efficient approach would be to use a loop to check divisibility up to the square root of x, rather than recursively calling the function for each divisible number.
