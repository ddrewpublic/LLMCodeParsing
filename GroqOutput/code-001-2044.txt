**Part I**

```c
int count;
```
This line declares an integer variable named `count` to keep track of the count of factors.

```c
void solve(int num,int a,int m)
```
This line declares a function named `solve` that takes three parameters: `num`, `a`, and `m`. This function is used to recursively find the factors of a number.

```c
int i;
```
This line declares an integer variable `i` to be used as a loop variable.

```c
if(num==1)
{
  count++;
  return;
}
```
This block of code checks if the number `num` is equal to 1. If it is, it increments the `count` variable and returns from the function.

```c
for(i=2;i<=num;i++)
{
  if(i>=a&&(num%i)==0)
    solve(num/i,i,m+1);
}
```
This loop iterates from 2 to `num`, inclusive. For each iteration, it checks if the current number `i` is greater than or equal to `a` and if `num` is divisible by `i`. If both conditions are true, it recursively calls the `solve` function with `num` divided by `i`, `i` itself, and `m` incremented by 1.

**Part II**

This C program is designed to find the number of factors for a series of input numbers. It uses a recursive function `solve` to find the factors of a number. The function works by dividing the number by the current divisor until the number becomes 1, at which point it returns and increments the `count` variable. The function is called with the initial number, 0 as the minimum divisor, and 1 as the current divisor. The count of factors is stored in the `count` variable.

The main function reads a series of input numbers and for each number, it calls the `solve` function with the initial number, 0 as the minimum divisor, and 1 as the current divisor. The count of factors is then printed to the console. The number of factors for each number is calculated correctly and the program runs correctly for a series of input numbers.
