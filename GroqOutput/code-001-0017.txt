**Part I**

```c
int fun(int x,int y)
{
    int i,sum=0;  // declare local variables i and sum
    for(i=x;i*i<=y;i++)  // loop from x to sqrt(y)
        if(y%i==0) {sum++;sum+=fun(i,y/i);}  // if y is divisible by i, increment sum by 2 (i and y/i)
    return sum;  // return the sum of divisors
}
```

**Part II**

This program calculates the sum of divisors for a set of given numbers. The `fun` function takes two integers `x` and `y` as input, and returns the sum of all integers `i` such that `x <= i <= sqrt(y)` and `y % i == 0`.

The `main` function reads a number `n` from the user, and then iterates `n` times. In each iteration, it reads another number `i` from the user, and calculates the sum of divisors of `i` using the `fun` function. The result is then printed to the console.

The program uses the fact that a number `i` is a divisor of `y` if and only if `y/i` is also a divisor of `y`. This allows the `fun` function to avoid calculating the same divisor multiple times, making it more efficient for large input values.
