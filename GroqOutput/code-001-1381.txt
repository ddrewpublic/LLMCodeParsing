**Part I**
```
int a,n,sum=0;
```
* Declaration of variables: `a`, `n`, and `sum`. `a` will hold a value to be checked for primality, `n` will hold the number of trials, and `sum` will keep track of the number of prime factors.

```
void t(int m)
{
    int i,j;
    for(i=m;i<=a;i++)
    {
```
* Definition of a function `t` that takes an integer `m` as a parameter. `i` and `j` are declared as variables that will be used in the loop.

```
        if(a%i==0)
        {
            a=a/i;
            if(a==1)
            {
                sum+=1;
            }
            else t(i);
            a=a*i;
        }
    }
}
```
* This function checks if `a` is divisible by `i`. If it is, `a` is divided by `i` and the `sum` is incremented by 1. If the result is not 1, the function is recursively called with `i` as the new value of `a`.

**Part II**

This program is designed to find the number of prime factors for a given number. The function `t` recursively checks for prime factors of a number and increments the sum for each prime factor it finds. The main function takes the number of trials and the values of `a` as input and prints the sum of its prime factors.

The function `t` works by dividing the input number by all numbers from `m` to `a` until no further divisions are possible, at which point it has found all prime factors of the input number. The sum of these prime factors is returned.

The main function uses this function to find the number of prime factors for a given number and prints this number.
