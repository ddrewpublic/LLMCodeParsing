**Part I: Code**

```c
int main()
{
    // Define a struct called Book to hold the book id and author
    struct Book{
        int id;
        char zz[26];  // Array of 26 characters to hold the author's name
    }book[1000];  // Create an array of 1000 Book structs

    // Declare variables
    int n,i,j,max=0,index;  // Number of books, indices, and maximum frequency
    int sum[26]={0};  // Array to hold the frequency of each author's letter
    char author;  // Author with maximum frequency

    // Read the number of books
    scanf("%d",&n);

    // Read the book information
    for (i=0;i<n;i++){
        scanf("%d%s",&book[i].id,&book[i].zz);
    }

    // Calculate the frequency of each author
    for (i=0;i<n;i++){
        for (j=0;book[i].zz[j]!='\0';j++){
            sum[book[i].zz[j]-'A']++;  // Convert character to 0-based index
        }
    }

    // Find the author with maximum frequency
    for (i=0;i<26;i++){
        if (sum[i]>max){
            max=sum[i];
            author='A'+i;  // Convert 0-based index back to 1-based 'A'...'Z'
        }
    }

    // Print the author and maximum frequency
    printf("%c\n%d\n",author,max);

    // Print the book ids of the author with maximum frequency
    for (i=0;i<n;i++){

            if (book[i].zz[j]==author){
                printf("%d\n",book[i].id);

**Part II: Summary**

This program reads information about books, including their IDs and authors, and then finds the author who appeared most frequently among all the books. The program uses a struct called `Book` to represent each book, with the `id` field storing the book's ID and the `zz` field storing the author's name. The program reads the number of books, then iterates through each book to record the frequency of each letter in the author's name. It then finds the author with the highest frequency and prints that author along with their frequency. Finally, the program prints the IDs of all books written by this author.
