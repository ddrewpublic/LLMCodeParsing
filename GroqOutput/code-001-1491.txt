Here is the code with developer comments added:

**Part I**
```c
int main()
{
    // Declare two integer variables, n and t
    int n, t;
    
    // Read the value of n from the input
    cin >> n;
    
    // Loop n times
    for(t = 0;t < n;t++)
    {
        // Declare an integer variable m
        int m;
        
        // Read the value of m from the input
        cin >> m;
        
        // Call the function f with parameters m and 2
        int f(int a, int min);
        cout << f(m, 2) << endl;
    }
    
    // Return 0 to indicate successful execution
    return 0;
}
```

**Part II**

This code is a solution to a problem that involves finding the sum of the proper divisors of a given integer. The `main` function reads the number of test cases (`n`), and for each test case, it reads an integer `m` and prints the sum of its proper divisors.

Here is a summary of the code:

The `main` function is the entry point of the program. It reads the number of test cases, `n`, and then for each test case, it reads an integer `m`, calls the function `f` with `m` and `2` as parameters, and prints the result. The `f` function recursively calculates the sum of the proper divisors of the given integer `a`. It starts from the smallest divisor `min`, which is initially set to `2`. If the current divisor `i` is greater than `a`, the function returns `0`, as there are no more divisors to consider. Otherwise, it checks if `a` is divisible by `i`, and if so, it recursively calls itself with `a` divided by `i` and `i` as parameters, adding the result to the running total.
