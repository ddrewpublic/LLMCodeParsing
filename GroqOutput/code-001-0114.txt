**Line 1-2:**
```
int resolution_into_factors(int j,int i)
{
```
This is a function declaration for a function named `resolution_into_factors` that takes two integer parameters `j` and `i` and returns an integer value.

**Lines 3-4:**
```
int m, sum=0, k=0;
```
These are variable declarations for three integer variables `m`, `sum`, and `k` and initialize them to 0.

**Lines 5-9:**
```
for(m=j ;m<=sqrt(i); m++)
{
    if(i%m==0)
    {
        sum=resolution_into_factors(m, i/m)+sum+1;
        k++;
    }
}
```
This is a for loop that iterates from `j` to the square root of `i` (inclusive). For each iteration, it checks if `i` is divisible by `m`. If it is, it recursively calls itself with `m` and `i` divided by `m`, adds the result to the `sum` variable, and increments the `k` variable.
