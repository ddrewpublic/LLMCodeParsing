**Part II**

This program calculates the number of divisors for each number in an array, and then prints the result. The function `f` takes two integer arguments, `a` and `min`, and returns the number of divisors of `a` that are greater than or equal to `min`. The function works by recursively dividing `a` by `i` (starting from `min`) and adding the result to the total count of divisors. If `a` is less than `min`, the function returns 0. The main function reads an integer `n` from the standard input, declares an array `a` of size `n`, reads `n` integers from the standard input and stores them in the array, and then calls the function `f` for each element in the array with `min` set to 2, and prints the result.
