```c
int num = 0;  // Initialize a variable to store the number of prime factors
int solution(int a, int b){  // Define a function to find the number of prime factors of a number
    for(int i = b; i <= a; i++){  // Iterate from b to a (inclusive)
        if(a%i == 0){  // Check if a is divisible by i
            a=a/i;  // Divide a by i to reduce the number
            if(a == 1) num++;  // If a becomes 1, increment the count of prime factors
            else num=solution(a,i);  // Recursively call the function for the updated value of a
            a=a*i;  // Multiply a by i to restore the original value
        }
    }
    return num;  // Return the count of prime factors
}

int main(){
    int n;  // Declare a variable to store the number of test cases
    cin>>n;  // Read the number of test cases
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++){  // Iterate through each test case
        int a;  // Declare a variable to store the input number
        cin>>a;  // Read the input number
        num=0;  // Initialize the count of prime factors for each test case
        cout<<solution(a,2)<<endl;  // Call the function to find the number of prime factors and print the result
    }

**Part II: Summary**

The provided code is designed to calculate the number of prime factors for each number in a given input. The `solution` function takes two integers `a` and `b` as input, and iterates from `b` to `a` (inclusive) to find the prime factors of `a`. The function recursively calls itself to account for all prime factors, and returns the total count.

The `main` function reads the number of test cases `n` from the input, and then iterates through each test case. For each test case, it reads a number `a`, initializes the count of prime factors to 0, and calls the `solution` function with `a` and 2 as input. The result is then printed to the console.
