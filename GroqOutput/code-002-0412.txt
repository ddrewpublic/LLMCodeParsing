**Part II**

This program is designed to find the most common letter in a series of strings and output the words that contain that letter. The program uses two loops to iterate through the strings and count the occurrences of each letter of the alphabet. It then identifies the most common letter and uses another loop to find the indices of the strings that contain that letter. Finally, it prints out the letter and count of the most common letter, as well as the words that contain that letter.

The program uses a combination of while loops and for loops to iterate through the strings and count the occurrences of each letter. It uses the `scanf` and `gets` functions to read in the strings, and the `printf` function to print out the results. The program uses integer arrays to store the counts of each letter and the indices of the strings that contain the most common letter.

Overall, this program is a good example of how to use loops and arrays to solve a programming problem. It demonstrates the use of different types of loops and arrays to iterate through data and store and manipulate the data.
