                sum += 1 + Factorization(x/i, i);  // Add 1 plus the result of the recursive function call with the quotient of x and the current number as arguments

**Part II: Summary**

This C++ program calculates the number of factors of a given input number and prints the result. The program uses a recursive function called `Factorization` to find the number of factors.

The `main` function reads the number of test cases from the input stream and then reads each input number and calls the `Factorization` function to find the number of factors. The result is then printed to the output stream along with a newline character.

The `Factorization` function takes two integer arguments, `x` and `y`, where `x` is the input number and `y` is the starting number for the factorization process. The function returns the total number of factors of `x`. It does this by recursively calling itself with the quotient of `x` and the current number as arguments until the quotient is less than 4, at which point the function returns 0.
