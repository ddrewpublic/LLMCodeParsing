**Part I**
```
struct 
{
    int num;
    char au[27];
}book[999];
```
**Declaration of a struct called `book` with an array of size 999. Each `book` structure contains two elements: an integer `num` and a character array `au` of size 27.**

```
int main()
```
**Start of the `main` function**

```
int m,a[26]={0},i,j,t,max=0;
```
**Declaration of variables: `m` to store the number of books, `a` to store the frequency of each letter (initialized to 0), `i`, `j`, and `t` to be used as loop counters, and `max` to store the maximum frequency.**

```
scanf("%d",&m);
```
**Read the number of books from the input**

```
for(i=0;i<m;i++)
{
    scanf("%d%s",&book[i].num,book[i].au);
    int au_n=strlen(book[i].au);
    for(j=0;j<au_n;j++)
    {
        if(book[i].au[j]<=90&&book[i].au[j]>=65) 
        {
            int k=book[i].au[j]-65;
            a[k]++;
            if(a[k]>max) max=a[k];
        }
    }
}
```
**Read the number and author name of each book, and for each author name, iterate through each character. If the character is a letter (checked by its ASCII value), increment the count in array `a` and update `max` if necessary.**

**Part II**
This C program reads information about multiple books, where each book has a unique number and an author name that is a string of uppercase letters. The program then finds the most frequent letter in all the author names and prints it, along with the maximum frequency. Finally, it prints the numbers of all books that have the most frequent letter in their author names. The program assumes that the input will be valid and does not perform any error checking.
