```
int fenjie(int n,int x){
    int i,t=0;       // Initialize a variable t to 0, not sure what this variable is used for
    for(i=x;i<=sqrt(n);i++){ 
        if(n%i==0){  
            t=t+1+fenjie(n/i,i); // Recursively call the function fenjie with n/i and i as arguments
        }
    }
    return t;    // Return the value of t
}
int main(){
    int i,t,n;
    cin>>t;
    for(i=0;i<t;i++){ // Iterate t times
        cin>>n;

    return 0;
}

**Part II**

Summary:

The code is a C++ program that calculates the number of prime factors of a given integer n. The function fenjie(n,x) takes two arguments: n, the integer to be factored, and x, the starting divisor. The function iterates from x to the square root of n, and for each divisor i, it recursively calls itself with the quotient n/i and the same divisor i, until i is no longer a divisor of n. The value of t is updated to include the number of divisors found. The function returns the value of t, which represents the number of prime factors of n.

The main function reads an integer t from the input, and for each iteration, it reads an integer n and calls the function fenjie(n,2), adding 1 to the result, which represents the number of prime factors of n including 1. The program outputs this value for each iteration.
