**Part II**

Summary:

This C++ program is designed to calculate the number of divisors for a given integer. The program uses a recursive function called `fen` to perform the calculation. The function takes two integer parameters: `n` which is the number to calculate the divisors for, and `i` which is the current divisor being checked.

The program receives a series of integers as input and calculates the number of divisors for each integer. The result is then printed to the output. The counter variable `t` is used to keep track of the number of divisors found.

The program works by dividing the input number `n` by the current divisor `i` as long as it is divisible. For each successful division, the function calls itself with the new value of `n` and the previous value of `i`. This process continues until `i` is greater than the square root of `n`, at which point all divisors have been found. The counter `t` is incremented each time a divisor is found.
