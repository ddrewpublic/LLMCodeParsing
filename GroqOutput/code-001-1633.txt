**Part II: Summary**

The provided code is a solution to a programming problem that involves finding the number of distinct divisors of a given number. The function `fj` takes two integers `a` and `zs` as input, and returns the number of distinct divisors of `a` that are greater than or equal to `zs`.

The function uses a recursive approach to find the divisors of `a`. It starts by checking if `a` is divisible by any number from `zs` to the square root of `a`. If it is, it recursively calls itself with `a` divided by the divisor and adds the result to a running total `n`. It also sets a flag `z` to 1 to indicate that `a` has a divisor.

If `a` is not divisible by any number in this range, the function returns 1, indicating that `a` has no divisors. Otherwise, it returns the total number of divisors `n+1`.

The `main` function reads the number of test cases and loops through each test case, calling the `fj` function with each number and 2 as input, and printing the result. The function then returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
