Here is the code with developer comments added:

```
void main()
{
    // Variable declarations
    int n, i, k[100], l[26]={0}, m=0, v, j;
    char c[100][26];

    // Read the number of strings from the input
    scanf("%d",&n);

    // Loop through each string
    for(i=0;i<n;i++)
    {
        // Read the length of the string and the string itself from the input
        scanf("%d %s",&k[i],c[i]);

        // Count the frequency of each character in the string
        for(j=0;j<strlen(c[i]);j++)
        {
            l[(int)c[i][j]-65]+=1;  // Convert the character to a numerical index and increment the count
        }
    }

    // Find the maximum frequency
    for(i=0;i<26;i++)
    {
        if(l[i]>m)
            m=l[i];
    }

    // Find the first character with the maximum frequency and print it
    for(i=0;i<26;i++)
    {
        if(l[i]==m)
        {
            printf("%c\n%d\n",(i+65),l[i]);  // Print the character and its frequency
            break;
        }
    }

    // Find the indices of all strings that contain the character with the maximum frequency and print them
    for(v=0;v<n;v++)
    {
        for(j=0;j<strlen(c[v]);j++)
        {
            if(c[v][j]==i+65)  // Check if the character is equal to the maximum frequency character
                printf("%d\n",k[v]);  // Print the index of the string
        }
    }
}
```

Here is the 200-word summary:

**Part II**

This program reads a number of strings from the input and analyzes the frequency of characters in each string. It then finds the character with the maximum frequency and prints it along with its frequency. Finally, it prints the indices of all strings that contain this character.

The program uses a combination of arrays and loops to accomplish this task. The `l` array is used to count the frequency of each character, and the `m` variable is used to keep track of the maximum frequency. The `i` variable is used to iterate through the strings and characters.

The program also uses the `scanf` function to read input from the user, and the `strlen` function to get the length of a string. The `printf` function is used to print output to the console.

Overall, this program demonstrates basic input/output operations and string manipulation in C programming.
