**Part II: Summary**

The provided code is a C++ program that factorsizes integers using the recursive algorithm of finding prime factors. The program takes input from the user for the number of times to factorize and the numbers to factorize. The code uses a recursive function `Factorize` to find the prime factors of a given number, starting from 2. The `number` variable is used to keep track of the number of factors found. The outcome of each factorization process is output to the console. The program executes multiple factorization processes based on the user input.
