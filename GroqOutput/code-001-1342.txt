**Part II: Summary**

This program is designed to take in a series of inputs, process each input using a recursive function, and then print out the result. The recursive function, `dg`, takes in two parameters: the input number and a limit. It then checks if the input number is divisible by any number between the limit and half of the input number. If it is, it recursively calls itself with the quotient and the current number. This process continues until the input number is less than the limit. Finally, if the input number is greater than or equal to the limit, the count is incremented. The main function reads in a number of inputs, loops through each input, resets the count, calls the `dg` function, and prints out the result. The program is designed to calculate the number of divisors for each input number.
