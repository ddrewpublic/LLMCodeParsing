**Part II**

This program calculates the number of prime factors of a given number. The prime factors are counted using a recursive approach, which is an optimization method for solving complex mathematical problems. The input and output of the program are from a file, not a console.

The program works as follows: 

1. First, it reads a number from the input. The number is the amount of times the program will repeat the process.
2. It then reads a number, say 'a', from the input. 
3. For each number 'a', the program calls a function 's(a,2)' and prints the result.
4. The function 's' counts the number of prime factors of 'a'. 
5. It does so by dividing 'a' by the numbers from 'b' to 1 (in our case, 'b' is 2), and for each division that yields an integer, it adds 1 to the count. 
6. If the division is not integer, or if 'a' divided by the current number is less than the number, it does not add anything to the count.
7. If the result is 1, that means 'a' has no more remaining factors to divide, so the function returns the count.
8. If 'a' has remaining factors, the function calls itself with 'a' divided by the current factor, and the current factor as the new 'a', and adds the result to the count. This is done until 'a' has no more remaining factors, at which point the function returns the final count.

The program prints the result of this process for each 'a' input.
