```
int n;
int next(int a,int b)
{
	if(a==1)
		return 1;  // Base case: when a is 1, return 1
	if(a<b)
		return 0;  // Base case: when a is less than b, return 0
	int sum=0;
	for(;b<=a;b=b+1)
		if(a%b==0)
			sum=sum+next(a/b,b);  // Recursive function call with a/b and b as arguments

	return sum;
}
```

**Part II**
Summary:

The following code is a C++ implementation of the sum of divisors function, which calculates the sum of all divisors of a given integer. The function `next` takes two integer arguments, `a` and `b`, and returns the sum of all divisors of `a` that are less than or equal to `b`. The function uses a recursive approach to calculate the sum.

In the `main` function, the program reads a number `m` from the input and then iterates `m` times, reading a number `n` from the input each time. It then prints the sum of all divisors of `n` that are less than or equal to 2.

This code can be used to calculate the sum of divisors of a given integer for various problems in number theory and combinatorics. For example, it can be used to calculate the sum of divisors of 6, which is 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 12.
