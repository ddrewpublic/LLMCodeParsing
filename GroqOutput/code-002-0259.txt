**Part I**

```c
struct book {
    int ISBN;
    char name[26];
}; b[999];
```
Declaring a structure for a book with an ISBN and a name of 26 characters. An array of 999 such structures is also declared.

```c
int main() {
```
Starting the main function.

```c
int i, j, m, k[26], max = 0;
```
Declaring several variables: i, j, m, max and an array k of size 26, all initialized to 0.

```c
char a, d = 'A';
```
Declaring a character variable a and initializing the character variable d to 'A'.

```c
for (i = 0; i < 26; i++)
    k[i] = 0;
```
Initializing the array k to 0, each element of the array will hold the count of a particular character in the names of all the books.

```c
scanf("%d", &m);
```
Reading an integer from the standard input and storing it in the variable m, this will denote the number of books.

```c
for (i = 0; i < m; i++)
    scanf("%d%s", &b[i].ISBN, b[i].name);
```
Reading m books from the standard input, each book is represented by a pair of input values: the first is the ISBN of the book and the second is the name of the book.

```c
for (a = 'A'; a <= 'Z'; a++)
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++)
        for (j = 0; j < 26; j++)
            if (b[i].name[j] == a)
                k[a - 'A']++;
```
Counting the frequency of each character in the names of all the books.

```c
for (i = 0; i < 26; i++)
    if (k[i] >= max)
        max = k[i];
```
Finding the maximum frequency of any character in the names of all the books.

```c
for (i = 0; i < 26; i++)
    if (k[i] == max)
    {
        d += i;
        printf("%c\n", d);
        printf("%d\n", max);        
    }
```
Finding the character with the maximum frequency and printing it.

```c
for (i = 0; i < m; i++)
    for (j = 0; j < 26; j++)
        if (b[i].name[j] == d)
            printf("%d\n", b[i].ISBN);
```
Printing the ISBN of all books whose name contains the character with the maximum frequency.

```c
return 0;
```
Returning from the main function.

**Part II**

This code is designed to find the most frequently occurring letter in the names of a set of books, and then print the ISBNs of all books whose name contains this letter. The books are input in the format of a pair for each book: the ISBN and the name. The letter frequency count is stored in an array, and the maximum frequency is used to determine the most frequently occurring letter. The code iterates over the books again to find the ISBNs of all books whose name contains this letter, and then prints these ISBNs. This problem is often solved using hash tables or arrays, but the code above uses arrays and nested for loops. This is an efficient solution because it has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of books.
