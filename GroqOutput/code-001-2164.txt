**Part I**

```
int f(int shu,int min)
{ 
  // Initialize a variable k to 1
  int k=1;
  if(shu < min)
  { 
    // If shu is less than min, set k to 0 and return
    k= 0; 
   return k;
  } 
  else
 {
  // Iterate through numbers from min to shu (exclusive)
  for(int i = min;i<shu;i++)
  { 
    // Check if shu is divisible by i
    if(shu%i == 0)
    { 
         // If divisible, recursively call f with shu/i and i, and add the result to k
         k=k+ f(shu/i,i); 
    } 
  
    
  } 
    // Return the final value of k
    return k; 
}
```

**Part II**

This code is a recursive function that calculates the sum of proper divisors of a number. The function `f` takes two integer parameters `shu` and `min`, and returns an integer value.

The function works by iterating through numbers from `min` to `shu` (exclusive), and checking if `shu` is divisible by each number. If it is, the function recursively calls itself with the quotient of `shu` and the current number, and adds the result to the sum. The function returns the sum of all proper divisors.

The main function reads `n` integers from the input, and for each integer, it calls the `f` function with the integer and the number 2 as arguments, and prints the result. The result is the sum of all proper divisors of the integer. The function continues until it has processed all `n` integers.

The code provided is a solution to the problem of finding the sum of proper divisors of a number, but it has a time complexity of O(n*shu), which can be improved by using a more efficient algorithm or data structure.
