**Part II: Summary**

The code above is a C++ program that outputs the count of prime numbers dividing a given number. The main function takes an integer `n` as input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a number `num` and then counts the number of primes that divide `num`. The count is calculated recursively using the `count` function.

The `count` function takes two parameters: `num` (the number to count) and `i` (the current number to check). It increments the counter `k` for each prime number that divides `num`, and then calls itself recursively with the quotient of `num` and `i`, and `i` as arguments. This process continues until the count of primes is complete.

The program prints the count of primes for each test case, plus one, because one is not considered a prime number. The overall output is the count of prime numbers for each test case.
