Here is the code with developer comments:

**Part I**

```c
void f(int,int);
int sum=0,res=1;
int main()
{
	// Read the number of inputs from the user
    int n,a,i,j;
    cin>>n;
    // Loop through each input
    for(i=0;i<n;i++)   // Input 'n' times
    {
        res=1;               // Initialize the result to 1
        // Read the current input
        cin>>a;
        // Find all the prime factors of the current input
        for(j=2;j<=(int)sqrt((float)a);j++)     // Check up to the square root of 'a'
        {
            // Check if 'a' is divisible by 'j'
            if(a%j==0)
            {
                sum=0;
                f(a/j,j);                // Recursively find the prime factors of 'a/j'
                res+=sum;
            }
        }
        // Output the result
        cout<<res<<endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
void f(int x,int y)
{
    // Base case: if x is 1, increment the sum
    if(x==1)
        sum++;
    // Recursively find the prime factors of x
    while(y<=x)                // Check up to x
    {
        // Check if x is divisible by y
        if(x%y==0)
            f(x/y,y);              // Recursively find the prime factors of x/y
        y++;
    }
    return;
}
```

**Part II**

This C++ code calculates the sum of prime factors for a set of given numbers. It takes an integer 'n' as input from the user, which denotes the number of inputs to be processed. Then, it takes each input and calculates the sum of its prime factors. The sum is calculated recursively by finding the prime factors of the input number and summing them up. The result is then printed out.

The code also uses a helper function 'f' to recursively find the prime factors of a given number. This function takes two parameters: the number 'x' and the prime factor 'y'. It first checks if 'x' is divisible by 'y', and if so, it recursively calls itself with 'x/y' and 'y'. This process continues until 'x' is reduced to 1, at which point the sum is incremented. The function returns once 'x' is reduced to 1.

Overall, the code efficiently calculates the sum of prime factors for a set of given numbers by recursively finding the prime factors and summing them up.
