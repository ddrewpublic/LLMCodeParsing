Here is the code with developer comments and a summary:

**Part I: Code with comments**

```c
struct jisuan{
    // Define a struct with two members: an integer and a character array of length 26
    int num;
    char name[26];
}book[1000];

int main()
{
    // Declare variables
    int i, j, m, n, k, e;
    int count[26]={0}, author[26];
    
    // Read the number of books
    scanf("%d",&m);

    // Initialize the author array with the ASCII values of uppercase letters
    for(i=0;i<26;i++)
        author[i]=65+i;

    // Read in the book information (number and name)
    for(i=0;i<m;i++){
        scanf("%d",&book[i].num);
        gets(book[i].name);
    }

    // Count the occurrences of each uppercase letter in the book names
    for(i='A';i<='Z';i++){
        for(j=0;j<m;j++){
            n=strlen(book[j].name);
            for(k=0;k<n;k++){
                if(i==book[j].name[k])
                    count[i-65]++;
            }
        }
    }

    // Swap the count and author arrays to find the most frequent letter
    for(i=0;i<25;i++){
        if(count[i]>count[i+1]){
            e=count[i];
            count[i]=count[i+1];
            count[i+1]=e;
            e=author[i];
            author[i]=author[i+1];
            author[i+1]=e;
        }
    }

    // Print out the most frequent letter and its count
    printf("%c\n%d\n",author[25],count[25]);

    // Find the book numbers that have the most frequent letter
    for(i=0;i<m;i++){
        n=strlen(book[i].name);
        for(k=0;k<n;k++){
            if(book[i].name[k]==author[25])
                printf("%d\n",book[i].num);
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```

**Part II: Summary**

This code reads in a list of books, each with a unique number and a name. It then finds the most frequent uppercase letter in the book names by counting the occurrences of each letter and swapping the count and author arrays. Finally, it prints out the most frequent letter and its count, as well as the book numbers that have this letter in their name. The code uses a struct to represent a book, with an integer field for the number and a character array field for the name. The main function uses several loops to read in the book information, count the occurrences of each letter, and find the most frequent letter.
