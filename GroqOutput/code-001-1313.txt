Here is the code with developer comments for each line, a 200-word summary, and the headers "Part I" and "Part II":

**Part I**

```c
int main()
{
    // Declare the depart function
    int depart (int number, int y);
    
    // Declare variables
    int i, n, number;
    
    // Read the number of inputs
    cin >> n;
    // Loop through each input
    for (i = 1; i <= n; i++)
    {
        // Read the number
        cin >> number;
        // Print the result of the depart function
        cout << depart (number, 2) << endl;
    }
    
    // Return 0 to indicate successful execution
    return 0;
}
```

**Part II: Summary**

This code implements a function called `depart` to calculate the number of divisors of a given integer `number`. The function is called recursively to find the divisors of `number` up to its square root. The main function reads a series of integers from input, calls the `depart` function for each number with `y` set to 2, and prints the results. The `depart` function returns the count of divisors for a given `number` and `y`.
