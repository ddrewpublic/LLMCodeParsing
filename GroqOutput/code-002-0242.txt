```c
void main()
{
    // Initialize variables
    int t = 0; // to keep track of maximum frequency
    int m; // number of strings
    int i, j, n, k; // loop counters
    int a[999]; // array to store lengths of strings
    int c[26] = {0}; // array to store frequency of characters
    char b[999][999]; // 2D array to store strings

    // Read the number of strings
    scanf("%d\n", &m);

    // Read the strings
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++)
        scanf("%d %s", &a[i], b[i]);

    // Calculate the frequency of each character
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++)
    {
        k = strlen(b[i]);
        for (j = 0; j < k; j++)

**Part II**

Summary: This program reads a set of strings and their corresponding lengths, then finds the character that appears most frequently in all the strings. It then prints the character and the frequency at which it appears. Finally, it prints the lengths of the strings that contain this character. The input is read from the standard input and the output is written to the standard output. The program uses a 2D array to store the strings and an array to keep track of the frequency of each character. The maximum frequency is found by iterating through the array of frequencies, and the character is found by iterating through the array of frequencies again and checking for the maximum frequency.
