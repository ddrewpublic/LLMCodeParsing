**Part II**

This program is designed to find the most frequent character in the author names of a series of checkout records. The program first reads the number of entries from the user, then reads each entry, which consists of an ID and an author name. It then loops through each possible uppercase letter (A-Z), counting how many times each letter appears in each author name. It keeps track of the letter that appears most frequently and the number of times it appears. At the end, it prints the most frequent letter and the number of times it appears, and then prints the ID of the first entry in the shuru array where the most frequent letter appears. The program assumes that the input will always be valid and does not include any error checking. It also assumes that the most frequent letter will not appear in more than one entry.
