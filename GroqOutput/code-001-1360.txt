Here is the code with developer comments:

**Part I**

```c
int sum=0,k=2; // Initialize variables sum and k

int fenjie(int n,int k) // Function to calculate the number of factors of a number
{ 
  int x,i,sum=0,p=0; // Initialize variables x, i, and p
  x=(int)pow(n,0.5); // Calculate the square root of the number n and store it in x
  for(i=k;i<=x;i++) // Iterate from k to x (inclusive)
   {
     if(n%i==0) { // Check if the number is divisible by i
       k=i; // Update k with the current value of i
       sum=sum+fenjie(n/i,k); // Recursively call the function with the updated k
       p=1; // Set p to 1 to indicate that a factor was found
     }
   } 
   if(p==0) return 1; // If no factors were found, return 1
   if(p==1) return sum+1; // If a factor was found, return the sum of factors plus 1
  }

int main() // Main function
{ 
  int m,n,i; // Initialize variables m, n, and i
  cin>>m; // Read the number of test cases
  for(i=0;i<=m-1;i++) // Iterate for each test case
  {
    cin>>n; // Read the number for which to calculate the number of factors
    cout<<fenjie(n,2)<<endl; // Call the fenjie function and print the result
    sum=0; // Reset sum for each test case
  }
  return 0; // Return 0 to indicate successful execution
}
```

**Part II - Summary**

The code is designed to calculate the number of factors for a given number. It uses a recursive approach to find all the factors of the number, starting from 2 (the smallest possible factor) and up to the square root of the number. For each potential factor, it checks if the number is divisible by that factor. If it is, the function calls itself recursively with the reduced number (i.e., the number divided by the current factor) and the updated factor value. The final result is the sum of all factors found, incremented by 1. The code is written in C++ and uses standard input/output operations to read and print the results.
