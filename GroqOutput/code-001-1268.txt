**Part I**

```c
int cal(int, int);
int main ()
{
    // Declare a variable n and initialize it to 0
    int n=0;
    cin>>n;
    // Read an integer value from the user and store it in n
    for (int i=0;i<n;i++)
    {
        int m=0;
        cin>>m;
        // Call the cal function with m and 2 as arguments and print the result
        cout<<cal(m,2)<<endl;
    }
    
    return 0;
}
// Function to calculate the sum of proper divisors of a number
int cal (int m,int i)
{
    int count=0;
    if (m==1) return 1; // Base case: if the number is 1, return 1
    for (i;i<=m;i++) // Iterate from i to m
    {
        
        if (m%i==0) // Check if i is a divisor of m
        {
              count+=cal(m/i,i);  // Recursively call cal with m/i and i as arguments
        }
    }
    // Return the count of proper divisors
    return count;
}
```

**Part II**

This code reads an integer value from the user and calculates the sum of proper divisors of all numbers up to that value. The `cal` function is used to calculate the sum of proper divisors of a given number. This function uses a recursive approach to find the divisors and their corresponding counts.

The code works by iterating from 1 to the given number and checking if each number is a divisor of the given number. If it is, the function recursively calls itself with the quotient (result of dividing the given number by the divisor) and the divisor as arguments. The result of each recursive call is added to the count.

The code is designed to efficiently calculate the sum of proper divisors for large values by avoiding unnecessary calculations. The use of recursion allows the function to handle large inputs and find the sum of proper divisors more efficiently.
