**Part II: Summary (200-word limit)**

The given code defines a recursive function `fj()` that calculates the sum of the total divisors of a given number `n`, starting from `m` which is 2 by default. The function iterates from `m` to `n` and checks if `n` is divisible by `i` in each iteration. If `n` is divisible by `i`, the function recursively calls `fj()` with `n` divided by `i` and `i` as arguments, and sums up all the results. The function returns the total sum of the total divisors of `n` when `n` is 1.

The `main()` function reads the number of test cases `n` and then reads each test case `i` and prints the total sum of the total divisors of `i` by calling `fj()` with `i` and 2. If there are more test cases, it prints a newline after each test case. The code is well-suited for calculating the divisors for a large number of test cases.
