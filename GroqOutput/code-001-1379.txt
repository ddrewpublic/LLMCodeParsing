**Part II: Summary**

This C++ program calculates the sum of all factors of a given number. The program reads a number of integers from the user and for each integer, it calculates the sum of its factors using a recursive function called `factorization`. The function takes two parameters: the number and a starting point for the search of factors. It returns the sum of all factors of the number. The program uses the `cin` and `cout` functions to read and print integers. The `sqrt` function is used to calculate the square root of a number. The program is simple and easy to understand, but it may be inefficient for large numbers due to its recursive nature.
