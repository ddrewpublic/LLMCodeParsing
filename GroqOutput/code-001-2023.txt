Here is the code with developer comments and a 200-word summary:

**Part I**

```
int fun(int i, int j, int count) {
  int k;  // declare a local variable k
  for (k = i; k <= sqrt(j); k++) {  // loop through numbers from i to sqrt(j)
    if (j % k == 0) {  // check if j is divisible by k
      count++;  // increment the count if j is divisible by k
      count = fun(k, j / k, count);  // recursively call the function with k, j/k, and the updated count
    }
  }
  return count;  // return the final count
}
```

**Part II**

Summary:
This code calculates the number of divisors for a given number. The `fun` function takes three parameters: `i`, `j`, and `count`, where `i` is the starting number, `j` is the target number, and `count` is the number of divisors found so far. The function recursively calls itself to find the divisors of `j` by dividing `j` by `i` and updating the count accordingly. The `main` function prompts the user to input a number `k` and then loops through numbers from 0 to `k-1`. For each number `n` in the range, it calculates the number of divisors using the `fun` function and prints the result.

Note: The `fun` function has a time complexity of O(sqrt(n)), where n is the target number, because it uses a recursive approach with a loop that iterates up to the square root of n.
