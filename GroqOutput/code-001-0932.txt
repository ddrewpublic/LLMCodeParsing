**Part II**

This code calculates the `A`th root of a given number `N`. The `get` function takes two parameters, `N` and `M`, and returns the `M`th root of `N`. The function uses a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem efficiently.

Here's a summary of how the code works:

* The `get` function first checks if `N` is 1, in which case it returns 1 as the 1st root.
* If `N` is not 1, the function decrements `M` until `M` is less than 2.
* If `N` is divisible by `M`, the function breaks the loop and returns 0 as the root does not exist.
* If `M` is 1, the function returns 0 as the root does not exist.
* Otherwise, the function recursively calls itself with `N/m` and `M-1`, where `m` is the largest integer that divides `N`, and returns the sum of the results.
* The `main` function reads the number of test cases, reads each test case, calculates the `A`th root of `N` using the `get` function, and prints the result.

The code uses a bottom-up approach to calculate the `A`th root of `N`, which is efficient and optimal for large values of `A` and `N`.
