Here is the code with developer comments and a summary:

**Part I: Code**

```c
int main()
{
    // Define a function `f` that takes two integer parameters `a` and `min` and returns an integer.
    int f(int a,int min);
    // Declare an integer array `a` with 150 elements and initialize it to 0.
    int n,a[150],i,b;
    // Read an integer `n` from the standard input.
    scanf("%d",&n);
    // Loop through the array `a` `n` times and read an integer from the standard input for each element.
    for(i=0;i<n;i++)
    {
        scanf("%d",&a[i]);
    }
    // Loop through the array `a` `n` times and call the function `f` with the current element `a[i]` and the minimum number `2`.
    // Print the return value of the function to the standard output, followed by a newline.
    for(i=0;i<n;i++)
    {
        b=f(a[i],2);
        printf("%d\n",b);
    }
    // Exit the program with a return value of 0.
    return 0;
}

int f(int a,int min)
{ 
    // Initialize a variable `result` to 1.
    int result=1,i;
    // If the parameter `a` is less than the minimum number `min`, return 0.
    if(a < min)
    {
        return 0; 
    } 
    // Loop through the numbers from `min` to `a-1` and check if `a` is divisible by the current number.
    for(i = min;i<a;i++)
    { 
        if(a % i == 0)
        { 
            // If `a` is divisible, recursively call the function `f` with `a` divided by the current number and the current number.
            result += f(a/i,i); 
        } 
    } 
    // Return the final value of `result`.
    return result; 
}
```

**Part II: Summary**

This program calculates the sum of all divisors of each element in an array using a recursive function. The function `f` takes two parameters, `a` and `min`, where `a` is the number to find its divisors and `min` is the minimum number to start the search from. The function returns the sum of all divisors of `a` that are greater than or equal to `min`.

The main function reads an array of numbers and for each element in the array, it calls the function `f` with the element and the minimum number 2, and prints the return value. The function `f` is recursive, which means it calls itself until it reaches the base case where the element is less than the minimum number. At each recursive call, the function sums up the divisors of the current element and recursively searches for divisors of the remaining part of the element. The program prints the sum of all divisors for each element in the array.
