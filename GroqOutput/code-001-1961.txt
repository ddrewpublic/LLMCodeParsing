**Part I**

```cpp
int fact(int a, int min)
```

* This function calculates the number of ways a number "a" can be factorized up to a certain minimum "min".

```cpp
if (a<min)
    return 0;
```

* If the number "a" is less than the minimum, the function returns 0, as there are no ways to factorize "a".

```cpp
int way = 1;
```

* This variable is used to store the number of ways the number "a" can be factorized up to the minimum "min". It is initialized to 1, as every number has a way (the number itself).

```cpp
for (int i = min; i <= sqrt((double)a); i++)
```

* This loop iterates over all the numbers from the minimum "min" to the square root of "a".

```cpp
if (a%i == 0)
    way += fact(a / i, i);
```

* If the number "a" is divisible by the current number "i", this function recursively calls itself with the number "a" divided by "i" and the number "i" itself. The result is added to the "way" variable.

```cpp
return way;
```

* The function returns the number of ways the number "a" can be factorized up to the minimum "min".

**Part II**

This program calculates the number of ways a number can be factorized up to a certain minimum. In the main function, the user is prompted to input a number "n". Then, for each of the "n" numbers, the user is prompted to input a number "c", and the program calculates the number of ways "c" can be factorized up to 2 and prints the result. The program then returns 0, ending the execution.

The function "fact(a, min)" is used to calculate the number of ways a number "a" can be factorized up to a certain minimum "min". If "a" is less than the minimum, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it iterates over all the numbers from the minimum to the square root of "a" and recursively calls itself with the number "a" divided by the current number and the number itself, adding the result to the variable "way". Finally, the function returns the number of ways "a" can be factorized up to the minimum.

The main function first prompts the user to input a number "n", then for each of the "n" numbers, it prompts the user to input a number "c" and calculates the number of ways "c" can be factorized up to 2 using the "fact(a, min)" function, and finally prints the result.
