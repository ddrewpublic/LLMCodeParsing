**Part I**

```
int c = 1;
```
* Initialize a variable `c` to 1. This variable will be used to count the number of divisors of a given number.

```
void fenjie(int a, int k)
{
```
* Define a recursive function `fenjie` that takes two integer parameters `a` and `k`.

```
	if (a == 1) 
	{
		c++;
		return;
	}
```
* If the input number `a` is equal to 1, increment the `c` variable and return from the function. This is the base case for the recursive function.

```
	for (int i = k; i <= a; i++)
	{
		if (a % i == 0)
		{
			fenjie(a / i, i);
		}
	}
```
* Iterate from `k` to `a` and for each number `i` that divides `a` (i.e., `a % i == 0`), recursively call the `fenjie` function with `a` divided by `i` and `i` as the new parameters.

**Part II**

This program calculates the number of divisors for a given number `a`. The function `fenjie` is a recursive function that finds all the divisors of a number by iterating from `k` to `a` and dividing `a` by each number that divides `a`. The `main` function reads input from the user, calls the `fenjie` function, and prints the result. The `c` variable is used to count the number of divisors.
