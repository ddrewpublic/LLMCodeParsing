**Part II: Summary**

This program is designed to calculate the number of distinct prime factors of a given integer. The main() function reads an integer from the user and then loops through a range from 1 to that integer. For each iteration, it reads another integer and calls the col() function to calculate the number of distinct prime factors of that integer. The col() function iteratively factors the input integer by dividing it by small prime numbers (starting from 2) and checking for divisibility. It recursively calls itself to factor the quotient, stopping when the quotient is less than the square root of the original integer. The function returns the total count of distinct prime factors found, which is then printed to the console.
