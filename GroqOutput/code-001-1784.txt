**Part II: Summary**

The provided code is a solution to a problem that involves calculating the number of proper divisors for a given integer. The `p` function takes two integers `a` and `m` as input and returns the number of proper divisors of `a` that are less than or equal to `m`. The function uses recursion to calculate the result.

In the `main` function, the code reads the number of test cases and then loops through each test case. For each test case, it reads the number and then loops through each divisor of the number from 2 to the number. The code then calls the `p` function with the number and each divisor and adds the result to a running total. Finally, the code prints the total number of divisors for the current test case.

The code is written in C++ and uses the `cin` and `cout` functions for input and output, respectively. The `return` statement is used to exit the program with a status code of 0.
