Here is the code with developer comments:

```
Part I: Code with comments
int main()
{
    // Declare an array to store a fixed number of integers
    int num[999] , 
        // Declare an array to count the frequency of each character in the alphabet
        count[27] = {0} , 
        // Declare an array to store the length of each string
        len[999];
    // Declare variables for iteration and maximum frequency
    int m , i , j , max = 0 , per;
    // Read the value of m from the input
    cin >> m;
    // Declare a 2D array to store the strings and their lengths
    char ch[999][26] , person;
    // Iterate m times
    for (i = 1 ; i <= m ; i++)
    {
        // Read the number and the string from the input
        cin >> num[i] >> ch[i];
        // Store the length of the string
        len[i] = strlen (ch[i]);
        // Iterate over the characters in the string
        for (j = 0 ; j <= len[i] - 1 ; j++)
        {
            // Increment the count of the character
            count[ch[i][j] - 64]++;
        }
    }
    // Iterate over the alphabet
    for (i = 1 ; i <= 26 ; i++)
    {
        // If this character has the maximum count, update the maximum count and the most frequent character
        if (count[i] > max)
        {
            max = count[i];
            per = i;
        }
    }
    // Convert the index of the most frequent character to the actual character
    person = per + 64;
    // Print the most frequent character
    cout << person << endl;
    // Print the count of the most frequent character
    cout << count[per] << endl;
    // Iterate over the strings again
    for (i = 1 ; i <= m ; i++)
    {
        // Iterate over the characters in the string
        for (j = 0 ; j <= len[i] - 1 ; j++)
        {
            // If the character matches the most frequent character, print the corresponding number and break
            if (ch[i][j] == person)
            {
                cout << num[i] << endl;
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```

And here is the 200-word summary:

**Part II: Summary**

This C++ program reads a series of strings and corresponding numbers from the input. It counts the frequency of each character in the alphabet and finds the most frequent character. The program then prints the most frequent character and the count of that character. Finally, it prints the numbers corresponding to the strings that contain the most frequent character.

The program uses a 2D array to store the strings and their lengths, and three additional arrays to store the counts of the characters in the alphabet, the maximum count, and the most frequent character. It uses two nested loops to iterate over the strings and their characters, and a third loop to iterate over the alphabet.

The program is designed to handle up to 999 strings and their corresponding numbers, and it uses the `cin` and `cout` functions to read and print the input and output respectively.
