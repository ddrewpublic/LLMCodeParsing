**Part I**

```c
void main()
{
   // Function declaration for factorial calculation
   int fac(int a,int b);
   int n,i,m,a[100]; // declaring array a of size 100 and varibles n, i and m
   scanf("%d",&n); // taking input from user for the size of the array
   for(i=0;i<n;i++)
   scanf("%d",&a[i]); // taking input from user for the array elements
   for(i=0;i<n;i++)
   {
      // calculating factorial for each element in the array
      m=fac(a[i],2);
      printf("%d\n",m); // printing the factorial value
   }
}
```

**Part II**

This program calculates the factorial of each element in an array. The user is prompted to enter the size of the array and the elements themselves. The factorial of each element is calculated and printed. The factorial calculation function uses recursion. If the element is less than the base of the factorial (which is always 2 in this case), the function returns 0. Otherwise, it iterates from the base to the element, checking for divisors and adding their factorial to the result.
