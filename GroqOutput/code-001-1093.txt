**Part II: Summary**

The code provided is a C++ program that calculates the number of distinct prime factors of a given integer `m`. The program uses the factorize function to recursively divide `m` by its prime factors until it reaches a prime number, which is 1. The number of distinct prime factors is then returned as the result.

The program also includes a main function that reads multiple values of `m` from the input and calls the factorize function for each value, printing the result to the console. The program uses a while loop to iterate through each value of `m`, reading the value from the input and calling the factorize function for each iteration.

Overall, the code provides an efficient way to calculate the number of distinct prime factors of an integer, making it useful for a variety of applications in number theory and cryptography.
