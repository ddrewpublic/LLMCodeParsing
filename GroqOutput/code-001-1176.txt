```cpp
int totalCount; // Counter for total factors of a number
void FindFact(int x, int max) // Function to find all proper factors of a number until a maximum value
{
	if (x == 1) // Base case: if the number is 1
	{
		totalCount++;
		return;
	}
	for (int i = max; i > 1; i--) // Iterate from max to 2
		if (x % i == 0) // Check if i is a factor of x
			FindFact(x / i, i); // Recursively find factors of the quotient
	return;
}
```

This is a recursive function that finds all proper factors (excluding 1 and the number itself) of a given number `x` until a maximum value `max`. It increments a counter `totalCount` for each factor found.

```cpp
int main()
{
	int n, x; // Loop variables
	for (cin >> n; n > 0; n--) // Read input until 0 is entered
	{
		totalCount = 0; // Reset the counter
		cin >> x; // Read the number to find factors
		FindFact(x, x / 2); // Find factors up to the square root of x
		cout << totalCount + 1 << endl; // Print the count plus 1 (because we don't count 1 as a factor)
	}
	return 0;
}
```

This is the main function, which reads input numbers until 0 is entered, finds the factors of each number using the `FindFact` function, and prints the count plus 1 (because we don't count 1 as a factor).

**Part II**

This code implements an algorithm to find the number of proper divisors (factors excluding 1 and the number itself) of a given number. It uses a recursive function `FindFact` to traverse down the divisor chain until the base case is reached. The maximum value `max` is chosen as the square root of the number, as any factor greater than this would have a corresponding factor less than it. The `main` function reads input numbers, resets the counter for each new number, and prints the total count plus 1.

The algorithm has a time complexity of O(sqrt(n)) for each number, making it efficient for large inputs. However, the recursive function may cause stack overflow for very large numbers.
