**Part I: Code with comments**

```c
// Define a structure called sa
struct sa {
    int a;  // integer variable a
    char b[100];  // array of 100 characters for variable b
    struct sa *next;  // pointer to the next structure of type sa
};

// Global integer variables
int n, m, k[27];  // n is the number of elements, m is the input number, k is an array of 27 elements

// Function to create a linked list
struct sa *kao(void) {
    // Initialize variables
    struct sa *head = NULL;  // head of the linked list
    struct sa *p1, *p2;  // pointers to structures of type sa
    int len = sizeof(struct sa);  // size of the structure

    // Read the number of elements and the first element from the user
    n = 0;
    scanf("%d %s", &p1->a, p1->b);

    // Initialize the head of the linked list
    head = p1;

    // Loop to create the linked list
    for (;;) {
        n++;
        if (n == m + 1) {
            break;  // stop when the desired number of elements is reached
        }

        // Read the next element from the user
        p2 = p1;
        p1 = (struct sa *)malloc(len);
        scanf("%d %s", &p1->a, p1->b);

        // Link the new element to the previous one
        p2->next = p1;
    }

    // Set the last element's next pointer to NULL
    p1->next = NULL;

    // Return the head of the linked list
    return head;

**Part II: Summary**

The provided C program is designed to read a stream of strings from the user and create a linked list of these strings. The program also counts the frequency of each character in the strings and finds the character that appears most frequently. Finally, it prints the most frequent character and the elements in the linked list that contain this character.

The `kao` function creates a linked list of strings by reading the strings from the user and linking them together. The `main` function initializes the linked list, counts the frequency of each character in the strings, finds the most frequent character, and prints the most frequent character and the elements in the linked list that contain this character.
