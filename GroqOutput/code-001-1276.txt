**Part I: Code with comments**
```
int f(int a, int min) {
    // if a is less than the minimum value, return 0
    if (a < min) {
        return 0;
    }
    // initialize a variable k to 1
    int k = 1, i;
    // loop from min to a-1
    for (i = min; i < a; i++) {
        // if a is divisible by i
        if (a % i == 0) {
            // increment k by the result of calling f with a/i and i
            k = k + f(a / i, i);
        }
    }
    // return the final value of k
    return k;
}

**Part II: Summary**

This C program calculates the sum of all proper divisors of each number in an input array. The function `f` takes two parameters, `a` and `min`, and returns the sum of all proper divisors of `a` that are greater than or equal to `min`. The function `main` reads an integer `n` and an array of `n` integers from the input, and for each number in the array, it calculates the sum of its proper divisors and prints the result. The proper divisors of a number are the numbers that divide it exactly, excluding the number itself. For example, the proper divisors of 6 are 1, 2, and 3.
