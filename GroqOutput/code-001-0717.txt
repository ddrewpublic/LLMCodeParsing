Here is the code with developer comments:

**Part I**

```c
void main()
{
    // Function prototypes for zy(int, int)
    int zy(int a, int b);
    // Declare variables
    int j, n, m, sum;
    // Read input for the number of test cases
    scanf("%d", &n);
    // Loop through each test case
    for (j = 1; j <= n; j++)
    {
        // Read input for the number to calculate the sum for
        scanf("%d", &m);
        // Calculate the sum using the zy function and print the result
        sum = zy(2, m);
        printf("%d\n", sum);
    }
}
```

**Part II**

Summary:
This program calculates the sum of all divisors of a given number for a specified range of test cases. The program defines two functions: `main()` and `zy()`. The `main()` function reads input for the number of test cases and loops through each test case, reading input for the number to calculate the sum for and calling the `zy()` function to calculate the sum. The `zy()` function takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, and recursively calculates the sum of all divisors of `b` that are greater than or equal to `a` until it finds a divisor `i` such that `i*i` is greater than `b`. The `zy()` function returns the sum of these divisors.

Note: The comments in the code are not accurate, the actual function `zy(int, int)` is meant to calculate the sum of all divisors of a number, not just the sum of all perfect squares.
