Here is the code with developer comments for each line:

**Part I: Code**

```c
int ge,s,w;  // Define integer variables ge, s, and w
void fen(int h,int a);  // Declare function fen with parameters h and a
int main()
{
    int n=0,k=0;  // Initialize variables n and k to 0
    cin>>n;  // Read an integer from standard input and store it in n
    for(k=1;k<=n;k++)  // Loop n times
    {
       cin>>s;  // Read an integer from standard input and store it in s
       ge=0;  // Initialize ge to 0
       fen(s,2);  // Call function fen with parameters s and 2
       cout<<ge<<endl;  // Print the value of ge followed by a newline
    }
    return 0;  // Return 0 to indicate successful program execution
}
void fen(int h,int a)
{
    for(int i=2;i<=h;i++)  // Loop from 2 to h
    {
        if((h%i==0)&&(i>=a))  // If h is divisible by i and i is greater than or equal to a
        {
            if(h/i!=1)  // If h is not equal to its largest factor
            {fen(h/i,i);}  // Recursively call fen with h/i and i as arguments
            else
            {ge++;}  // Increment ge if h is equal to its largest factor
        }
    }     
}
```

**Part II: Summary**

This program calculates the number of prime factors of a number. It reads a number n from the user, and then for each number from 1 to n, it reads another number s and calculates the number of prime factors of s using the function fen. The result is then printed to the standard output.

The function fen takes two parameters, h and a. It iterates from 2 to h and checks if h is divisible by i and i is greater than or equal to a. If both conditions are true, it recursively calls itself with h/i and i as arguments until h is no longer divisible by i. It increments the count ge each time it finds a prime factor. Finally, it prints the value of ge as the number of prime factors of the original number.
