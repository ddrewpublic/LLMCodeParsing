**Part II: Summary**

This code calculates the sum of all proper divisors of each integer from 1 to n (inclusive), where n is an input number. The factorization function takes an integer a and an integer k as inputs and returns the sum of all proper divisors of a that are greater than or equal to k. 

The code starts by reading the input number n. Then, for each number from 1 to n, it calculates the sum of all proper divisors using the factorization function. The factorization function uses a recursive approach to find all divisors of a number and adds them up. 

The code handles the base cases where a is 1 or 2, and calculates the square root of a to limit the search for divisors. The sum of all proper divisors is returned as the result. This code can be used to solve problems that require calculating the sum of divisors of a number, such as sum of proper divisors of all numbers from 1 to n.
