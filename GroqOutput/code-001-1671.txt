```c
// This is a function that calculates the number of ways to express a number as the product of primes
int f(int a, int b)
{
    // Base case: if 'a' is 1, return 1 because there is only one way to express 1 as the product of primes
    if (a == 1)
        return 1;
    else
    {
        // Variables used to keep track of intermediate calculations
        int c, d, i;
        // Initialize 'c' to 0
        c = 0;
        // Calculate the square root of 'a' and store it in 'd'
        d = (int)sqrt((double)a);
        // Loop through numbers from 'b' to 'a' (inclusive)
        for (i = b; i <= a; i++)

**Part II: Summary**

This code calculates the number of ways to express a number as the product of primes, using a function `f` that takes two parameters: the number to be expressed and the starting point for the prime factors. The function uses a recursive approach to find all the prime factors of the number and counts them. The `main` function reads input from the user, calls the `f` function for each test case, and prints the result. The code uses the `sqrt` function to optimize the search for prime factors, making it more efficient for large numbers. The `cin.get()` statements at the end are likely used to pause the program and wait for the user to press a key before exiting.
