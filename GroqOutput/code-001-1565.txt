```c
int num(int b,int min); // function prototype for num function
int x=1,m; // variable x initialized to 1 and m is not initialized yet
int main()
{
    int a,n,b; // variable declaration
    scanf("%d",&n); // read input from user
    for(a=0;a<=n-1;a++) // loop until a reaches n
    {
        scanf("%d",&b); // read input from user
        m=b; // assign input to variable m
        b=num(b,2); // call num function with input and 2 as arguments
        printf("%d\n",b); // print output
        x=1; // reset x to 1
    }
    return 0; // end of main function
}
int num(int b,int min)
{
    int a,c; // variable declaration
    for(a=min;a<b;a++) // loop until a reaches b
    {
        if((b%a==0)&&(b/a>=a)) // check if b is divisible by a and b/a is also greater or equal to a
        {
            if(num(b/a,a)==1) // if b/a is also divisible and result of num function is 1
            {
                x++; // increment x
            }
        }
        if(a==m-1) return x; // if a is equal to m-1, return the value of x
    }

**Part II**

This code is used to find the number of prime factors of a number. The `num` function takes two parameters, `b` (the number to be factored) and `min` (the smallest divisor to check). It returns the number of prime factors of `b` using a recursive approach.

In the `main` function, the program reads an integer `n` from the user, then loops `n` times. In each iteration, it reads another integer `b` and prints the number of prime factors of `b` calculated by the `num` function.

The `num` function iterates from `min` to `b-1` and checks if `b` is divisible by each number. If it is, it recursively calls itself with `b/a` and `a` until it finds a prime factor. The number of prime factors is returned as the final result.

The program uses the variable `x` to keep track of the number of prime factors found. It is reset to 1 in each iteration of the `main` loop and incremented each time a prime factor is found.
