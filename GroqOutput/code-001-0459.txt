**Part II**

Summary:

The provided C++ code, named e.cpp, is a program that calculates the sum of all proper divisors of a given integer. The program reads input from the user, takes an integer `n`, and then prompts the user to enter `n` more integers. For each entered integer, the program calculates and prints the sum of its proper divisors, excluding the integer itself.

Here is the code with developer comments:

```
// Function to find the sum of all proper divisors of a given integer
int find_factor(int a, int b) {
    // Initialize a variable to store the sum of divisors
    int i, sum = 0;
    // Check if the integer is 1, in which case its sum of divisors is 1
    if (a == 1) return 1;
    // Iterate from the given integer `b` to `a`
    for (i = b; i <= a; i++) {
        // Check if `i` is a divisor of `a`
        if (a % i == 0)
            // Recursively call the function to find the sum of divisors of the quotient
            sum += find_factor(a / i, i);
    }
    // Return the sum of divisors
    return sum;
}

// Main function
int main(void) {
    // Read an integer `n` from the user
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    int a;
    // Iterate `n` times
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        // Read an integer `a` from the user
        cin >> a;
        // Calculate the sum of divisors of `a` and print it
        cout << find_factor(a, 2) << endl;
    }
    // Return 0 to indicate successful execution
    return 0;
}
```
