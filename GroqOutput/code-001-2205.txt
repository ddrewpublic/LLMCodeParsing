Here is the code with developer comments for each line, and a 200-word summary:

**Part I: Code with comments**

```cpp
int dp[40000][200] = {0}; // initialize a 2D array dp with size 40000x200, filled with zeros
int main() {
    int n, i, N; // declare variables n, i, N
    int mm(int, int); // declare a function mm that takes two integers as arguments

    cin >> n; // read an integer fromSTDIN and store it in variable n
    for (i = 1; i <= n; i++) { // loop n times
        cin >> N; // read an integer fromSTDIN and store it in variable N
        cout << mm(N, 2) << endl; // call the function mm with arguments N and 2, and print the result
        // if (prime(N)) cout << "haha"; // commented out code, likely for testing purposes
    }

    return 0; // exit the program with status code 0
}

int mm(int n, int i) {
    int sum = 1; // initialize a variable sum to 1

    if (dp[n][i] > 0) return dp[n][i]; // if the result is already computed for this value, return it

    for (int j = i; j <= sqrt(n); j++) { // loop through numbers from i to sqrt(n)
        if (n % j == 0) { // if n is divisible by j
            sum += mm(n / j, j); // recursively call mm with the quotient and j as arguments, and add the result to sum
        }
    }
    dp[n][i] = sum; // store the computed result in the dp array
    return sum; // return the computed result
}
```

**Part II: Summary**

The code provided is a C++ program that calculates the sum of the divisors of given integers. The program uses dynamic programming to memoize the results of sub-problems, so as to avoid redundant computations. The `mm` function takes two arguments: an integer `n` and an integer `i`. It returns the sum of all divisors of `n` that are greater than or equal to `i`. The `main` function reads integers fromSTDIN, calls the `mm` function with the first integer and 2 as arguments, and prints the result. The program uses a 2D array `dp` to store the computed results. The time complexity of the program is O(n*sqrt(n)) due to the nested loops and the recursive calls.
