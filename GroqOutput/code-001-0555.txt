**Part I**

```c
int sum=0;
```
// Initialize the sum variable to 0.

```c
void f(int x, int i)
{
```
// Define a recursive function f that takes two integer parameters, x and i.

```c
double m=sqrt(x);
```
// Calculate the square root of x and store the result in the variable m.

```c
if(i<m)
{
```
// If i is less than the square root of x, then enter this block.

```c
if(x%i==0)
{
```
// If x is divisible by i, then enter this block.

```c
sum++;
```
// Increment the sum variable by 1.

```c
f(x/i,i);
```
// Call the function f recursively with the new values of x and i.

```c
}
```
// End of the if(x%i==0) block.

```c
f(x,i+1);
```
// Call the function f recursively with the new values of x and i+1.

```c
}
```
// End of the if(i<m) block.

```c
if(fabs(i-m)<0.00000001)
```
// Check if the absolute difference between i and m is less than 0.00000001.

```c
sum++;
```
// If the condition is true, then increment the sum variable by 1.
}
```
// End of the function f definition.

**Part II**

This code is used to find the count of prime numbers up to a given number 'n'. The function f is a recursive function that checks if the current number 'x' is divisible by 'i' and if not, then it calls itself with the new value of 'x' and 'i+1'. The base case is when 'i' is greater than the square root of 'x', or when 'i' is very close to the square root of 'x' (to avoid floating point precision issues). The sum variable is used to keep track of the count of prime numbers. The main function reads the input 'n', calls the function f for each number up to 'n', and prints the count of prime numbers.
