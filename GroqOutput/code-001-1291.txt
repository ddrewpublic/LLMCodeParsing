**Part I: The Code**

```c
int sum = 1;// initialize sum to 1
int Fact(int x, int y){// function definition for calculating factorial
int main() {
    int n, a;
    cin >> n; // take input for number of terms
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> a;  // take input for each term
        sum = 1; // reset sum to 1 for each term
        Fact(a, 2); // calculate factorial for each term
        cout << sum << endl; // print the sum
    }
    return 0;
}

int Fact(int x, int y) {
    if (x == 1)
        return 0; // base case: 1 is not a prime number
    else {
        for (; y <= sqrt(x); y++)// check for prime factors up to sqrt(x)
            if (x % y == 0) {
                sum = sum + Fact(x / y, y); // recursively add factor to sum
            }
        return 1;
    }
}
```

**Part II: Summary**

This code calculates the sum of the prime factors for a given set of numbers. The input is taken in the form of a sequence of numbers, and for each number, the program calculates the sum of its prime factors. The prime factors are calculated using a recursive function called `Fact`, which takes two parameters: the number to be factored and the current divisor. The function checks if the number is divisible by the divisor, and if so, recursively calls itself with the quotient and the same divisor. The base case is when the number becomes 1, indicating that it is not a prime number. The sum of the prime factors is printed at the end.
