Part I

```
int t;
```
Integer variable 't' is declared to store the count of factors.

```
int f(int a,int b){
```
This is a function 'f' that takes two integer parameters 'a' and 'b'.

```
int i;
    for(i=a;i*i<=b;i++){
```
This is a for loop that starts from 'a' and continues until the square of 'i' is less than or equal to 'b'. It checks each integer from 'a' to square root of 'b' for factors.

```
        if(b%i==0){
```
This condition checks whether 'b' is divisible by 'i'.

```
            t++;
            f(i,b/i);
```
If 'b' is divisible by 'i', then the function is called recursively again with 'i' and 'b/i' as parameters, and the count 't' is incremented.

```
return t;
```
The function 'f' returns the value of 't', which represents the number of factors of 'b'.

Part II

Here's a summary of the provided code. This program calculates the number of factors for each number from 1 to a given 'n'. The 'f' function is used to find the number of factors of a given number. It does this by dividing the number by all the integers from 2 to the square root of the number and checking if each integer is a factor. The 'main' function prompts the user to enter the number 'n' and then reads the numbers to be checked. The results are stored in an array 'result' and are printed to the console.
