```c

    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {

**Part II: Summary**

The program reads a number of authors and their strings from input. For each author, it calculates the frequency of each character in the string and finds the character with the maximum frequency. It then prints the character with the maximum frequency and its frequency, as well as the authors who have the character with the maximum frequency. The program uses a struct to hold author information and dynamically allocates memory for the authors. The character frequency is calculated by subtracting 65 from the ASCII value of each character to get its integer index, and then incrementing a corresponding element in the `zimu` array. The maximum frequency and the corresponding character are found by iterating through the `zimu` array.
