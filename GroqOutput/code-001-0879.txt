**Part I: Code with Comments**

```c
int function(int num, int k) {
  /* Declare local integer variables j and m */
  int j;
  int m = 0;
  
  /* Check if the input number is greater than 1 */
  if (num > 1) {
    /* Loop from k to num, incrementing j by 1 */
    for (j = k; j <= num; j++) {
      /* Check if num is divisible by j */
      if (num % j == 0) {
        /* Recursively call the function with num/j and j */
        m = m + function(num / j, j);
      }
    }
    /* Return the calculated value */
    return m;
  } else {
    /* If num is 1 or less, return 1 */
    return 1;
  }
}
```

**Part II: Summary**

The program consists of two main functions: `function` and `main`. The `function` takes two integer inputs, `num` and `k`, and returns the sum of all divisors of `num` that are greater than or equal to `k`.

In the `main` function, the user is prompted to input a number `n`, which represents the number of integers to process. The program then reads in `n` integers, stores them in an array `num`, and calculates the sum of divisors for each integer using the `function`. The results are then printed to the console.

The program uses a recursive approach to calculate the sum of divisors, with a base case when `num` is 1 or less. Overall, the program provides a useful tool for analyzing the properties of integers.
