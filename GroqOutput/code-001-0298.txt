Here is the code with comments and a summary:

**Part I**

```c
int numcheck(int num,int a)// Function to check if a number is abundant
{
	// Initialize variables
	int i=0,sum=0; 

	// Base case: 1 is always 1
	if(num==1)// base case - 1 is not abundant
		return 1;

	// If the number is less than 'a', it's not abundant
	else if(num<a)
		return 0;

	// Otherwise, recursively check for divisibility starting from 'a'
	else
	{
		for(i=a;i<=num;i++)// loop until 'i' reaches the number itself
		{
			if(num%i==0)// if 'i' is a divisor of the number
				sum=sum+numcheck(num/i,i); // add the sum of the divisors of the quotient
		}
	}

	return sum;
}
```

**Part II**

Summary:

The given code is used to check if a number is abundant. An abundant number is a number where the sum of its proper divisors is greater than the number itself. The code uses a recursive function `numcheck` to achieve this. The function takes two parameters: the number to check (`num`) and a starting point for the search of divisors (`a`).

In the `main` function, the code reads in a number of input values, checks each value using the `numcheck` function starting from 2 (since 1 is not a proper divisor), and then prints the result. This results in a list of abundancy checks for a series of input numbers.

Note: The given code assumes that the input numbers are all positive integers.
