    // Define a struct called "book" to hold an integer and a character array
    struct book

    // Declare an array to hold integer values initialized to 0
    int c[999]={0};

    // Declare character arrays
    char str1[20],str2[20];

    // Read integer input
    scanf("%d",&n);

    // Loop through the input
    for(i=0;i<n;i++)
    {
        // Read integer and string input
        scanf("%d %s",&book[i].a,&book[i].b);

        // Get the length of the string
        m=strlen(book[i].b);

        // Copy the string to str1
        strcpy(str1,book[i].b);

        // Count the frequency of each character in the string
        for(j=0;j<m;j++)

    }

**Part II**

This program reads a number of book records, each consisting of an integer ID and a string title. It counts the frequency of each character in each title, and then finds the most common character. It then prints the character and its frequency, and finally prints the IDs of all books that have this most common character in their title.

The program can be improved by handling cases where two or more characters have the same maximum frequency. Additionally, it can be extended to handle non-ASCII characters by modifying the range in the for loop where max is calculated.
