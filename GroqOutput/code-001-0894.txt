**Part I**

```c
int d;
```
Declaring a variable `d` of type `int`.

```c
int fen(int i,int a)
```
Defining a function `fen` that takes two integer parameters `i` and `a`.

```c
{
  if(i>a)
  {
   return 0;
  }
```
Checking if the value of `i` is greater than `a`. If true, the function returns 0.

```c
  int result=1;
```
Initializing a variable `result` to 1.

```c
  int j;
```
Declaring a variable `j` of type `int`.

```c
  for(j=i;j<a;j++)
  {
    if(a%j==0)
    {
      result=result+fen(j,a/j);
    }
  }
```
Using a for loop to iterate from `i` to `a-1`. If `a` is divisible by `j`, recursively call the `fen` function with arguments `j` and `a/j`, and add the result to `result`.

```c
  return result;
```
Returning the value of `result`.

**Part II**

This code is used to find the number of proper divisors of a number. A proper divisor is a divisor that is less than the number itself. The function `fen` takes two parameters `i` and `a`, and it returns the number of proper divisors of `a` that are greater than or equal to `i`.

In the `main` function, the user is prompted to enter a number `n`. Then, the program reads `n` numbers and calculates the number of proper divisors for each number. The results are printed to the console.

The program uses a recursive approach to calculate the number of proper divisors. The `fen` function calls itself recursively until it reaches a point where the number of divisors is 0, and then it sums up the results to find the total number of divisors.

The program also includes some unnecessary lines that read input but do nothing with it. This is likely due to some debugging artifacts and can be removed.
