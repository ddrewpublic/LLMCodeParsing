```c

void f(int m, int n, int l) {
    int i; // Initialize a loop counter
    for (i = m; i <= n; i++) {
        if (n % i != 0) { // Check if 'i' is not a factor of 'n'
            continue; // If not, move to the next iteration
        } else {
            if (n / i == 1) { // Check if 'n' is divisible by 'i' only once
                x[l]++; // Increment the count of prime factors for the current number
                return; // Return from the function
            } else {
                f(i, n / i, l); // Recursively call the function for the next number
            }

        s = 2; // Initialize 's' to 2 (the smallest prime number)
        f(s, a[j], j); // Call the function to find the prime factors

**Part II: Summary**

This C++ code is designed to find and count the prime factors of each number in a given input array. The program reads the total number of inputs and the individual numbers, then uses a recursive function `f()` to find the prime factors. The function `f()` takes three parameters: the start value `m`, the end value `n`, and the array index `l`. It iterates over the range from `m` to `n` and checks if each value is a factor of `n`. If a value is a factor, it recursively calls itself with the new values `i` and `n/i` until `n` is reduced to 1. The prime factors are stored in an array `x`, and the count of prime factors for each number is printed at the end. The program outputs the count of prime factors for each number in the input array.
