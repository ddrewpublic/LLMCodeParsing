Here is the code with developer comments added:

**Part I**

```
int s=0; // Initialize a variable s to 0
void find(int min,int dev)
{
    int i; // Initialize a variable i to 0
    for(i=min;i<=sqrt((float)dev);i++) // Loop until i is less than or equal to the square root of dev
       if(dev%i==0) // Check if dev is divisible by i
          {
                 s++; // Increment the value of s
                 find(i,dev/i); // Recursively call the function with i and dev/i as arguments
          }
}
int main()
{
    int n,i,m,j; // Declare variables n, i, m, and j
    scanf("%d",&m); // Read an integer input from the user and store it in m
    for(j=1;j<=m;j++) // Loop m times
    {
        scanf("%d",&n); // Read an integer input from the user and store it in n
        for(i=2;i<=sqrt((float)n);i++) // Loop until i is less than or equal to the square root of n
            if(n%i==0) // Check if n is divisible by i
              {
                     s++; // Increment the value of s
                     find(i,n/i); // Recursively call the function with i and n/i as arguments
              }
        printf("%d\n",s+1); // Print the value of s plus 1
        s=0; // Reset the value of s to 0
    }
    //getchar();
    //getchar(); // These lines are commented out, likely for debugging purposes
    return 0;
}
```

**Part II**

This code is used to find the number of divisors for a given set of numbers. The `find` function is a recursive function that finds the divisors of a given number `dev`. It starts from the minimum number `min` and checks if `dev` is divisible by `min`. If it is, it increments the counter `s` and recursively calls itself with `min` and `dev` divided by `min`. This process continues until `min` is greater than the square root of `dev`. The main function reads a number `m` from the user and then reads `m` numbers `n`. For each `n`, it finds its divisors using the `find` function and prints the result. The counter `s` is reset to 0 after printing the result for each `n`.
