**Part II: Summary**

This program is used to find the number of proper divisors of a given integer. The function `f` takes two integer parameters: `begin` and `m`. It iterates from `begin` to `m`, checking if each number is divisible by `m` and if `m/i` is greater than or equal to `i`. If both conditions are met, it increments the sum and recursively calls `f` with `i` and `m/i` as the new parameters. The loop breaks when `i` becomes greater than `m/i`. The main function reads an integer `n` and a sequence of integers `m` from the input. For each `m`, it calls `f` with 2 as the initial value and `m` as the maximum value, prints the sum, and resets the sum to 1.
