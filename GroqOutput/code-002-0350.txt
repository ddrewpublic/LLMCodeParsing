**Part II: 200-word Summary**

This program reads a list of book pairs, where each pair consists of a book number and a writer's name. It then analyzes the writer's name to find the most frequently occurring character and prints the character along with the count of its occurrences. Finally, it loops through the list of book pairs again and prints the book number of each book that contains the most frequently occurring character. This program can be used to identify the most popular character in a list of book authors and find the corresponding books. The code is written in C and uses arrays and loops to perform the necessary calculations and printing.
