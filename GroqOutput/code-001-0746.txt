**Part II**

This code calculates the number of distinct divisors of a given number N, where N can range from 1 to 200. The approach used is to iterate through all numbers from 1 to N, find their divisors, and store them in arrays. Then, it updates the array f[i][j] representing the number of distinct divisors of i at j-th level.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(N^(3/2)), where N is the size of the input. This is because for each pair of divisors, we are performing a constant time operation to check if they are equal.

The space complexity is O(N), which is the space required to store all the divisors and their corresponding indices. This is because we are storing a maximum of N divisors for each number, and there are N numbers.
