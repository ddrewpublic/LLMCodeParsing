**Part I**

```c
int begin=2;
```

* The variable `begin` is initialized to 2. This variable is used to keep track of the next possible divisor of a number.

```c
int main()
{
```

* The `main` function is defined, which is the entry point of the program.

```c
	int f(int);
```

* A function prototype for `f` is declared, which takes an integer as input and returns an integer.

```c
	int n=0,x=0,i=0;
```

* Three integer variables `n`, `x`, and `i` are declared and initialized to 0.

```c
	cin>>n;
```

* The user is prompted to input an integer value for `n`.

```c
	for(i=0;i<n;i++)
	{
```

* A `for` loop is started that will iterate `n` times.

```c
		cin>>x;
```

* The user is prompted to input an integer value for `x` in each iteration of the loop.

```c
		cout<<f(x)+1<<endl;
```

* The function `f` is called with the input `x`, and the result is incremented by 1. The output is then printed to the console.

```c
}
	return 0;
}
```

* The `for` loop finishes, and the `main` function returns an integer value of 0 to indicate successful execution.

**Part II**

This program finds the number of prime factors of a sequence of numbers entered by the user. The prime factors are counted using a recursive function `f` that takes an integer as input. The `f` function returns the number of prime factors for a given number. The main function reads the number of inputs from the user, and for each input, it calls the `f` function to find the number of prime factors and prints the result.
