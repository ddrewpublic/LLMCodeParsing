**Part II: Summary**

This is a C++ program that calculates the sum of all divisors of a given natural number n, excluding n itself. The program uses a recursive function f(x, b) to calculate the sum of all divisors of x, starting from b. The function f calls itself recursively until the parameter x is less than b, at which point it returns 0. The program then prints the result of f(a, 2) for each input number a, where a is an integer read from the input. The function f returns the sum of all divisors of x, starting from 2, which is a efficient way to calculate the sum of divisors for large numbers.
