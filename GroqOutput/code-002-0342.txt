**Part II**

This C code is designed to find the most frequent character in a list of book titles and print the title(s) of the book(s) that contain this character. The code uses a struct array to store the book titles and their corresponding publication years. The character frequency is calculated using an array t, where t[i] represents the frequency of the i^{th} character of the alphabet (A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25). The maximum frequency is then used to find the character with the maximum frequency. The code then prints the character and its frequency, and finally prints the title(s) of the book(s) that contain this character.
