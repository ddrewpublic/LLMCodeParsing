**Part II**

Summary:

The code provided is a C++ program that calculates the number of divisors for each input number within a given range. The program defines a recursive function `f` that takes two integer parameters: `min` and `a`. The function returns the total count of divisors for the number `a` starting from `min` up to the square root of `a`. The `main` function reads input values, calls the `f` function for each value, and prints the results.

In the `f` function, the recursive formula is `num = num + f(i, a/i)`, where `i` is the current divisor and `a/i` is the new value of `a`. This formula ensures that all divisors are counted, including non-distinct ones (e.g., 1 and 2 are both divisors of 2). The function returns the total count of divisors after traversing all possible divisors.

In the `main` function, the program reads input values `m` and `a` from the standard input, calls the `f` function for each value of `a`, and prints the results. The program uses the `cin` and `cout` streams for input and output operations, respectively.
