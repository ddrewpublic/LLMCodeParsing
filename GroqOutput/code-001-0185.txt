Here is the code with developer comments:

**Part I: Code**

```
int f(int m,int k);
int main()
{
    // Declare variables to hold the value of n, and three integer values i, k, and m
    int n, i, k, m;
    // Read the value of n from the input stream
    cin>>n;
    // Iterate from 1 to n (inclusive)
    for(i=1;i<=n;i++)
    {
        // Read the value of m from the input stream
        cin>>m;
        // Initialize k to 2
        k=2;
        // Call the function f with arguments m and k, and print the result
        cout<<f(m,k)<<endl;
    }
    // Return 0 to indicate successful program termination
    return 0;
}

int f(int m,int k)
{
    // Declare a local variable m1 to hold the original value of m
    int m1;
    // Declare a local variable sum to hold the result of the function
    int sum=1;
    // Set m1 to the original value of m
    m1=m;
    // Iterate from k to the square root of m (inclusive)
    while(k<=(int)sqrt(m))
    {
        // If m is divisible by k, divide m by k and add the result of the function f(m, k) to sum
        if(m%k==0)
        {
            m=m/k;
            sum=sum +f(m,k);
        }
        // Reset m to its original value
        m=m1;
        // Increment k by 1
        k++;
    }
    // Return the result of the function
    return sum;
}
```

**Part II: Summary**

This program reads an integer value n from the input stream, and then iterates from 1 to n. For each iteration, it reads an integer value m from the input stream, and calls a recursive function f with arguments m and 2. The function f calculates the sum of all divisors of m, and returns this sum. The result of the function call is then printed to the output stream. The recursive function f iterates from 2 to the square root of m, and for each iteration, it checks if m is divisible by the current value of k. If it is, it divides m by k and adds the result of the function f(m, k) to the sum. This process continues until k exceeds the square root of m. The sum of all divisors is then returned as the result of the function.
