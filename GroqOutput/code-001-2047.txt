Here is the code with developer comments for each line, and a 200-word summary at the end:

**Part I: Code**

```c
int sum = 1; // Initialize a variable to keep track of the sum
void f(int i, int j) {
    int k; // Initialize a variable to use in the loop
    if (i == 1) {
        sum++; // If the number is prime, increment the sum
    } else {
        for (k = j; k <= i; k++) { // Loop through all divisors of the number
            if (i % k == 0) {
                f(i / k, k); // Recursively call the function for the quotient
            }
        }
    }
}

int main(void) {
    int i, j, k, n, a; // Declare several integer variables
    scanf("%d", &n); // Read the number of test cases
    while (n--) { // Loop through each test case
        sum = 1; // Reset the sum for each test case
        scanf("%d", &a); // Read the number for which to find the sum of divisors
        for (i = 2; i * i <= a; i++) { // Loop through all numbers up to the square root of a
            if (a % i == 0) { // If a is divisible by i
                f(a / i, i); // Recursively call the function for the quotient
            }
        }
        printf("%d\n", sum); // Print the sum
    }
    return 0; // Return 0 to indicate successful execution
}
```

**Part II: Summary**

This program is designed to calculate the sum of all proper divisors of a given number. It uses a recursive function `f` to find the divisors of a number, and a loop to iterate through the numbers up to the square root of the given number. The program reads in a number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads in a number and prints the sum of its proper divisors. The program uses the fact that if `a` is divisible by `i`, then `a/i` is also divisible by `i`, allowing it to recursively find all divisors of `a`.
