Summary:

Part II

This program calculates the sigma function values for a sequence of positive integers. The sigma function (also known as the sum of divisors function) takes an integer as input and returns the sum of its divisors (excluding the number itself). The program uses a recursive approach to compute the sigma function values, starting from the smallest divisor and recursively calling itself until the base case of 1 is reached. The main function reads a sequence of positive integers from standard input, computes the sigma function values for each integer using the fg function, and prints the results.
