**Part II: Summary**

This program is a mathematical script that calculates a sequence of numbers based on a recursive function called calc. The function calc takes two integer parameters, a and b, and returns an integer value. The function checks if a^2 is greater than b, and if not, it checks if b is divisible by a. If b is divisible by a, the function recursively calls itself with a and b divided by a, and adds the result to the result of a recursive call with a+1 and b. If the above conditions are not met, the function recursively calls itself with a+1 and b.

In the main function, the program reads an integer n from the input, and then iterates through n iterations. In each iteration, the program reads an integer a from the input, and calculates the result using the calc function. The result is then printed to the console.
